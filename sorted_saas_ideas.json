            "Sorry to be cynical, but isn't this entire post basically a giant advertisement for your SaaS website?\n\n> Tuesday Jan 24th: Sign up at Launch27 (Full disclosure: I\u2019m an owner)\n> This is going to be the software that runs the entire business, from booking form, to recurring bookings, to credit card integration, to customer database, the entire shebang. The booking form you get here you will add to your website with a simple copy and paste. \n\nI mean, maybe you didn't intend it to come across that way, but it follows the pattern pretty clearly. \"Look at these people making $$$ using my system! Follow these easy steps and you can too! Just sign up for my website for $59/month...\"",
            "It seems to me the biggest challenges you would have but somehow overcame would be the one that hit Homejoy (or supposedly did): \n\n1) Clients engaging jobs directly with your cleaners which means every new client is client just a few times and cleaners cycle rapidly.\n\n2) Having cleaners perform reliably, consistently and honestly without all the human issues that plague companies with employees.\n\nAre your hiring filters enough to take care of that or are there other things that you do systematically? How much firefighting do or did you have to do (X cleaner doesn't show up, panic time or cleaner/customer drama)?",
            "Thanks for the post. It seems like a lot of the value you/we can provide is customer service and I would expect that to equal phenomenal reviews on Yelp as you mention that as a big tool for gaining customers.\n\nLooking at Yelp for Maids in Black and Lawntribe in DC you're at 4 and 3.5 stars respectively. Many of your competitors have 5 stars with 50+ reviews.  What's the main reason for the lower reviews with your companies?  \n\nPlease don't take this as any knock on you or your businesses. I just think that most of us see you as the gold standard for service businesses and if this is an area you are struggling with it would be really difficult for those of us looking to start.  Especially once our business grows and we are trying to provide great service for an ever expanding customer base.\n\nThanks again for all you contribute to this sub!",
            "Getting a few reports on this so I thought I would recognize the issues raised and make sure everyone knows what is going on.\n\n**Reports about self-promotion and spam:** u/localcasestudy owns launch27.com and Groovehiring which he points out.  These sites provide services for service booking businesses. When you read his posts please keep in mind he does have cause to favor it - but he also points that out himself (\"...if we do say so ourselves..\"). People doing AMAs are allowed to provide a modest number of links to their company if it is material to their AMA which certainly seems to be the case here. Given that guideline, given that there are no affiliate links in the OP and given the relative amount of information to links I don't think the post would qualify as spam, particularly given ongoing involvement in Q&A. One other concern might be if the video content were all self-promotional. I will be reviewing the videos shortly but given the titles/descriptions I don't expect them to be simply cloaked sales pitches for real information.\n\n**One report was for threatening and harassing.** There doesn't seem to be anything like that in the OP. If you were serious about this report please contact the mods. If a comment was harassing please report that specific comment so we can investigate. \"Harassing\" means attacks on you as a person it does not mean saying something you disagree with or attacking your concepts, thoughts or position on issues. Criticism is fair game. Name-calling or worse is not. We take these type of reports very seriously but reporting something as threatening to try to raise alarm level when it is not is just as serious. Only use this type of report if you are being harassed or threatened.\n\n\n---\nEdit: So this post explaining why I did what I did has now been reported as \"Mod team are shills\" and \"Fucking stupid.\" Everyone is free to respond to this post and point out why I am wrong. I listen to that and consider it. If you make a solid case I will change my position on things. It is important to me to be logical and rational and that means recognizing I can be wrong. \n\n---\nEdit: I'm asking the other mods to take a look and review the post to find out if I was in error making this a sticky as an AMA and to make sure I am not being biased in evaluating the reports. I would much prefer a discussion of why people see this as an ad rather than an AMA (yes, I do understand the formatting suggests ad and the phrasing feels marketing but when I drill down to look at how much is actually promotion I see promotion of a concept rather than a service. Haven't reviewed the videos yet though.) Please tell me how I am wrong. I will be reviewing the back and forth both in this post and others.\n\n---\nEdit: So a fair number of the reports seem to be saying it is improper to have this stickied. One asked how much I was paid to sticky it (nothing incidentally, I thought it would qualify to be stickied under our past AMA guidelines). Since that was just my call and since I've asked the broader mod team to review it I will be unstickying it until they do so and decide how to go. **Was it a mistake for me to sticky it? I think so but not for the reasons you might think.** I think it was acceptable to do so under our policies for AMAs but I don't think that it helped the community. The post was already visible to everyone because of the supporting upvotes it had received. Stickying it just pissed off people who didn't want to see it. I didn't see that coming and apologize for missing it and doing the wrong thing. Trying to help and failed. Sorry",

            "In my limited time bootstrapping my own stuff, I raise a glass to your list.\n\nMy version:\n\n* **B2B > B2C** (except if you've some specialized unserved niche that you can have an app up and running in a few days and are willing to just gamble).\n* **No VC** - I haven't done VC, but hear horror stories. One interview I heard yesterday said, if you make a $2M business as a bootstrapped company you're a success. But in VC you need to get to $100M. However, how many businesses can get to a $100M valuation. You're setting yourself up for failure.\n* **Nail outreach** - distribution will make or break you. Outreach + no product = pre sell product. Product + no outreach = no sales.\n* **Yes to SEO & Content; No to relying on it 100%** - Google is seriously monkeying with search results. So you need SEO and content, but make sure you have other avenues as well.\n* **Piggyback off other traffic sources** - Reddit, Pintrest, Quora, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, etc. Know them. Love them.\n* **The Time Investment to Validation Ratio** - the longer it will take to build something, the longer you should take to validate it. If you can get it up in a weekend or a week, then you can risk less validation.\n* **Off the shelf as much as possible** - At the beginning you have no idea if your project will work. So it's easier to start with a $199 boilerplate than spend 3 months reinventing the wheel. Use as many off the shelf and free tools as you can. Google Forms are your friend. You can even create signable documents in JotForm for free.\n* **Tiny MVP:** I know so many successful projects that started out as a Excel or Google sheet. Start with the minimum minimum viable product. Try to not code at all until you have paying customers.\n* **The \"Jay Leno\" approach** - If at all possible have a day job. When your project gets traction, then jump to it. Jay Leno said he's never lived off his tonight show money. He lives off the earnings from his stand up gigs. I've seen a lot of successful projects that were helped by this model.\n* **Either people buy your product/service or they don't** - You'll get so many \"that's a great idea\" or \"I'd be open to using your service in 6 months when you launch\" or \"I love this, let me talk to my boss\" or \"this could be a great partnership for us where we can send you a lot of business let's spend the next 6 months working out a deal\" or \"how about we use your service for an equity deal in our company that hasn't made any money yet\". Farts in the wind. Cash in hand is the ultimate validation.\n* **Research, Research:** Look up how much competition you'll have on Google. Find a successful business model to copy and ask what are their traffic sources and how long have they been successful. Understand your market.\n* **The Long Haul:** Something may be a great idea, that serves a market, that's validated, that's easy to build, but ... do you want to work on this idea and promote it for the next 3-5 years? Launching is one thing. Continuing to put effort into it is a whole other challenge.\n* **Sunk Cost Quicksand:** It's very hard to kill a project after you've put years into it. I've been working on a site for 2 years with zero monetary returns. Currently I'm transitioning it to a more passive model and will let it just exist. But it's very hard not to want to put more effort into it when I know it could have potential. One developer says if you haven't made any money with it in 3 to 6 months, you should probably kill it. However, I know a project that's currently making $70K MRR but it took them 3 years to get to $1K MRR. So it's a tricky balance to know if you're being persistent or being a fool.\n* **Get to Money Sooner:** Big funded companies can afford to exist in the red for years (or a decade), but most of us have limited money, time, and effort. The faster you can get a project, website, business to cash, they sooner you'll know you have traction.\n* **Some other lessons:** [https://twitter.com/adamdenverco/highlights](https://twitter.com/adamdenverco/highlights)",

            "Good post OP. I just have a nit pick.\n\n> Today I have 1 fullstack dev doing 5x more progress on a project than a team of 12 back then. Avoid \"teams\" at all costs.\n\n30+ year Senior Dev here (who's also started and worked for startups). I retired earlier this year, but they just pulled me back in. Probably the most well known project I worked on was Apple's iCloud for instance. I wrote the load balancer they used to scale the huge Exabyte storage needs they had.\n\nYou probably have a really good fullstack dev. Or your apps are pretty simple. But at the end of the day it's impossible to have expertise in everything. Tech is just too complex for that. A person who keeps up with all the Front end madness that is happening (React, Svelte, TypeScript, node...) cannot possibly also be at the cutting edge about infrastructure the way a DevOps Engineer can. A guy writing front end will not be able to maintain a complex Kubernetes Operator in Go at the same time.\n\nThere is just too much context switching. And vice-versa, a DevOps guy isn't going to be great at front end design. Sure they can do it, but it will take 3 times longer and it won't look quite right.\n\nI'm sorry but that's just not a thing. In development pretty much every area is constantly evolving, and you have to keep up with it. No single person can really keep up with everything. \n\nIt just sounds like your businesses needed more front end guys, and you were hiring the wrong people for the job. Likely outsourcing difficult scaling back-end issues to other IaaS/SaaS providers.\n\nThough I do agree, 1 bad ass can outwork a team of 5 for sure. Hope you're paying your guy well.",

Can't, please stop wasting our time. \n\nThis is something I wish the CEO would stop bringing up. Meetings with consultants... advice on how to do things. Talk is cheap.",
            "My mistakes of the most recent 2 startups (still going but not for much longer). I will try and keep one going as it's abit of a unicorn in my area, but it doesn't cover the bills on its own. I'll probably need staff so I can go back to a normal job.\n\n1. Maxing loans and buying loads of equipment, thinking I can do lots of different services. I'm seriously in the brown at the moment, highly unmotivated, burnt out, and completely lost with lots of toys, but no initiate or drive to do anything.\n\n2. Doing way way too much. For 2 years, I'd worked nearly ever hour I could, working full time 7-5 5 days a week, 5-11 and weekends on my 2 startups. 1 is the unicorn and niche, but only seasonal. The other was going to be the complimentary income. I've now finished my full time role, but it's caused me to go into a spiral. I'm unmotivated, lonely, tired all the time, and instead of it giving me 45 to 50 hours back a week, my output on the 2 side hustles just filled that time still with the same output/turnover, it's a mental and physical disaster. I'm over weight, in debt and mentally and financially at wits end! (Why can't I just be a normal person, 9-5 and play golf or hang out with my wife and friends? I'm highly self destructive!\n\n\nHaving a rubbish accountant. I'm still paying a lot of money and not getting anything good back. I've gone Limited after not taking any solid advice. For my last tax return, they did a soft check, made sure everything lined up roughly, then pressed send on my accounts software, and automatically submitted a return. Absolutely wasting money there.\n\nTaking on staff who, as op said... I wouldn't hug. They've rinsed my business of profit by doing half assed work... Left a bad taste in the mouth of any customer they've worked for... the majority of which I either lost or am still having to correct mistakes unpaid. I am trying to be a good manager.

It was just some silly little consolidated order form / checkout process (ROrder) for some web host billing softoware that was popular at the time (Modernbill) before they got bought out by Plesk. \n\nI've always loved building software, and creating things from nothing, and that little project earned me about 10k in sales over a summer before I ended up selling the product to someone else a year later. At 21 you'd better believe I was stoked. It was the first glimpse I had of it actually being possible to earn a living doing something I love. \n\nI continued to run a small web hosting service and take on one-off coding requests form clients. Almost all of which went on my resume. As someone who didn't finish college, I needed all of the experience I could get. A couple of years later, a small company reached out to me, through monster.com (god I'm old, lol). I've been with the same company for almost two decades now, and I couldn't imagine doing anything else. \n\nAll because of some project that I cooked up over a summer. I sincerely hope you find success. You've got this."

            "Thanks for the insight. It was an interesting read.\n\nI actually agree with you when you talk about finding a product that solves the problem, if there is a market for it then it's probably one of those businesses that could explode. My question would be related to supply, you spoke about how your friend wanted those hoodie blankets so there must have already been people who sell those products otherwise they wouldn't have thought about buying it. So my questions are:\n\n1. How saturated was the market when you started your business?\n2. What was the key differentiator between your product and the competitors that made the business work?\n3. How did you source the product?\n\nIf you don't mind sharing your answers for those, it would be a great learning point for me as an aspiring entrepreneur.",

Restaurants, landscaping, heck even vacuum\u2019s. \n\nCompetition is GOOD. It means the idea works, and you can make a metric ton of money by thinking of not something new to do, but how to do something better. \n\nYou\u2019ll also save a ton of time as you won\u2019t be spending it on your own half-baked ideas.",

If you pursue those kind of trends you need to be prepared to get the next one, and while the first one works and is in full swing you need to come up with the next, and do a lot of flips.\n\nthat's a thing you can do, and as any thing, some might have success some might not due to various reasons, came too late, didn't execute right, had too big prices, to low profit margin.\n\nI would apply a different strategy:\n\n- choose a boring service or product you can do and build on that\n\n- keep a minimum level job that helps you survive for at least 2 years\n\n- have patience, the more boring your product or service the better, of course you have to have people using that kind of product or service.

I**s there demand for this solution? is this addressing a burning pain?** in this case it's not. I agree with the fact that there is room for custom forms and that's why there are too many solutions. But the big question is are they profitable? There are some people looking for custom solutions but are they big enough a market for building a custom product? Are they all looking for the same solution or they are asking for very high customization?\n\n**2. Can I build and sell this solution?** building it would be easy, but selling it would be tough. First of all, OP admits it's a crowded market. And some of the players are funded. If you are competing with funded players for marketing space, we all know the outcome (look at Uber Vs Taxi industry, Airbnb vs individual hotel owners)\n\n**3. Am I interested in creating this?** well, in case you are trying to build something from an idea subscription, you have to wait in a never ending queue to see something you are really passionate about. That's my opinion from the subscription.\n\nI've never seen anyone in my life who failed in a business and admitted that they failed because their idea sucked (including myself). The reason is when people come up with an idea themselves, they would find a ton of different excuses except for the fact that the idea sucked. People have that conviction about an idea because it's original. But will they be able to build something and have equal conviction in case of borrow-and-build approach?",

Also sharing your methods has resulted in you validating the need for another paid product which is a bonus! :)\n\nRegarding your price - I think $29 pcm is fine - if you do a weekly podcast and podigniter saves you an hour+ of time then that's well worth $7.50 - it can even add revenue to your bottom line when it remembers to bill sponsors on time! \n\nAs a pair of fresh eyes I have a few initial points of feedback - \n\n* **Branding Emphasis Needed**  The name (or a logo) needs to be more prominent to be memorable - if people try to re-visit at a later date as you add features they will have a hard time remembering your name & are unlikely to currently find you through search. \n* **Clarify Your Headline** - The phrase 'on top of' feels a little vague. 'Organize' or 'Automate Repetitive Tasks' are more powerful - your target market will identify with feeling unorganised or having to regularly do tasks manually\n* **Your Audience Is Split** - You have 2 very distinct markets, new & established podcasters. Brand new podcasters don't yet know the pain of podcast administrivia & may not instantly see the value. They don't yet have sponsors so signing up to any paid product pulls them further away from profitability. This crowd will tell you your product is 'expensive' when it's not. Established podcasters with high paying sponsors would probably pay 10x your price but may be too set in their ways to move over to a new service. They may demand more features as they attempt to completely replicate what they do themselves. If you're aiming for 'easy to use' avoid adding everything they ask for. Be mindful of which audience you are writing your copy for. \n* **Social Proof** - Getting some known podcasts using this service would a huge credibility indicator if you could put their logo on your site. Their mentions would be great advertising at $0/little cost.\n\nI know it's early days & you may have all of these ideas & possibilities in mind anyway - write them all down & any one you find yourself writing down multiple times are obviously have recurring needs. \n\nLooking forward to hearing how it progresses for you over the coming months!

The problem you have is that the asset you have is: \"Relationships with executives, directors and decision makers of said industry.\" and you need to convert this asset into sales. Product development happens with the customer. You need the customer first. So you need to think about what is the minimum thing you can sell to said executives, directors, and decision makers today, or well at best literally next month. \n\nMaybe the burden of switching to your platform is too high and you need to create a plugin for their existing platform.

Figured out how much money you can reasonably expect to make - and compared that with the cost ($5K? $20K? $100K?) or developing your service?   Let's say you can get everything working for $50K.  Is the income going to surpass that? \n\nIf you are CERTAIN  - then:\n\n\\- Draw pictures of the APP, make a presentation, and go show it to a couple of potential customers.  Tell them you are NOT trying to sell this to them. Just wanting their input on your idea - and then ask them what it might be worth to them (monthly, yearly, whatever).  \n\n\\- Adjust your economic projections based on their answers.  Maybe you over/underestimated the value of your idea.   (And you said it is a \"local\" idea... which I assume limits it's value.  If you can re-purpose to other \"local\" areas, obviously that greatly increase the value of your service. \n\n\\- If it's still worthwhile based on above, then write up a \"technical\" document that explains exactly what the service is (page 1)... and how the software/service would work.  I.e, show every screen your users would see, and explain to the computer programer(s) exactly what each screen and each button would do.  Draw pictures and notate them with arrows to each button, etc. \n\nYour software development costs increase with complexity.  E.g.,  if you have different levels of users (Admin, super user, basic user) that is more complex than a \"stand along\" system with only one type of user.  \n\n\\- Take your tech doc and find some developers to talk to.  Their pricing will be all over the place.  Make sure they have working examples of their work that demonstrate they know how to do what you need.  (E.g. Do you need 3 types of users? Have they done something with different types of users?)   If you go to them and say \"I need this (pointing to tech doc) can you do this?)\"  - you can figure out which can or can't do the project - then ask them to give you a price and a timeline.

Who needs to get greasy when a virtual mechanic can diagnose issues in their PJs?\n\n**Why now?:** The gig economy is thriving, and with platforms like JustAnswer booming, this innovative idea taps into a very lucrative and growing $500 billion gig economy market.\n\n**2. Real Estate Crowdfunding Platform**  \nTurning every couch potato into a landlord without the hassle! Crowdfunding as an option for those who want to brag about their real estate prowess without actually doing anything.\n\n**Why now?:** Given the inflationary environment and increasing interest in real estate as a hedge, collective investing platforms are gaining attention. The global real estate crowdfunding market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 58% by 2028.\n\n**3. EcoInsurance**  \nInsurance that actually wants to save the planet, rather than just ignoring it.\n\n**Why now?:** With biodiversity and climate crises looming, companies are starting to realize that eco-friendly is not just cool, it's necessary. Particularly with $20 billion annually needed to combat biodiversity loss globally.\n\n**4. Deepfake Defence Force**  \nProtect the world from cyber-fakes with a SaaS solution detecting AI-driven deepfakes. It's like having your personal Sherlock Holmes, but for the digital age.\n\n**Why now?:** Internet scams leveraging deepfake technology are on the rise, taking advantage of increasingly sophisticated AI tools to deceive people on a massive scale.\n\n**5. AI Powered Restaurant Management System**  \nWhy rely on humans when AI can handle restaurant operations? Revolutionize dining experiences with a digital butler.\n\n**Why now?:** Post-pandemic, restaurants are embracing tech like never before. The global market for restaurant management software is set to grow by 14.3% annually.\n\n**6. Single Parent Match**\n\nThis dating app is specially designed for single parents juggling kids, work, and finding love. Because you shouldn\u2019t have to choose between finding a soulmate and finding a babysitter!\n\n**Why Now?**: The single parent population is growing rapidly, with over 11 million single parent families in the US alone. Traditional dating apps often overlook the unique needs and challenges faced by single parents.\n\n**7. Digital Safe space for Teens**  \nCreate a digital platform offering safe, moderated chat rooms and forums where teens can discuss mental health, academic pressures, and everyday challenges anonymously. Picture a space where teens can vent, share memes, and get support without worrying about trolls or oversharing.\n\n**Why Now?**: The mental health of young people has been significantly impacted by the pandemic, with rising rates of anxiety, low mood, and self-harm. A digital safe space can provide crucial support outside of school hours .\n\n**News Trigger**: Antidepressant use in child mental health services increased by 44% in the last decade",

Sometimes you can also do general research to know if in fact that there is a demand in an industry.  Sometimes its much more difficult to tell and you have to do alot more customer feedback and validation sessions.",
            "Hi,\n\nMaking sure your B2B SaaS idea is good before you start building it is really important. It can help you save time and money. You wonder if you\u2019re being too careful by not talking to people until you have something to show, but I personally think getting feedback early can actually be super helpful. \n\nIf you talk to a few people you trust, they can give you good advice without you feeling like you\u2019re using up your contacts. Just let them know you\u2019re looking for feedback, not trying to sell them anything.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about reaching out to people you don\u2019t know to get their thoughts, that can work too. You can make a quick survey or talk to people to see if your idea makes sense to them. \n\nYou can also try some other ways to check or see if your idea is good. \n\nFor example, you can make a simple web page that explains your idea and see if people sign up for updates. This can show you if people are interested. If you have time, making a basic version of your tool can help you get feedback. There are tools that let you make a simple version of your software without needing to actually code it.\n\nRemember, this advice is coming from someone who\u2019s really good at launching Private Label (PL) products on Amazon. So if you want more information about PL, just let me know!\n\nThanks",
            "You're not being too cautious. Your network is valuable, and you're right to save it for when you have something concrete to show. Don't burn those connections on early-stage validation.\n\nCold outreach can work for idea validation, but it's not great. Here's a better approach:\n\n   - Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find people matching your ICP. Send InMails (not DMs).\n   - Export that list to a tool like Apollo or RevenueBase to get their email addresses.\n   - Clean the list with Reoon to remove bad emails.\n   - Use an email outreach tool like Smartlead to send personalized cold emails.\n   - Keep your daily send volume under 30 per email address for good deliverability.\n   - Offer something valuable in exchange for their time (industry insights, gift card, etc.)\n\nYou don't need hundreds of responses. Even 20-30 good conversations can provide solid validation. Once you have a demo, then leverage your network for real deals.\n\nSource: I run a B2B email outreach agency (OutreachBloom)",

A couple of problems you may run into early that I want to warn you about:\n\nYour product development overhead may be low but you'll have to deal with customer support, bug fixes, deployment issues, server cost if your product does well, marketing etc.\n\nWhen you hire a developer or a team of developers, you need to retain them for the long term. You're product is going to go through many different iterations before you find product market fit and the speed at which you need to iterate in order to capture the market needs to be there. This will cost you more than having a technical cofounder.\n\nFinding a developer is easy. Finding a good developer is hard. Finding a good developer who cares enough about the product to move fast enough...\n\nSaas isn't going anywhere. With the help of no code tools and AI, you can build an MVP and validate your idea. And you can learn how to code and build out your project at the same time.\n\nGood luck to you",

            "I come from a software background. And I'll give some counter intuitive ideas here I have learnt the hard way. \n\n1. With saas and software it is very easy for someone to copy you and build what you have so unless you really have a technical advantage, most saas businesses are not successful. \n\n2. You need to catch a wave + do something naughty. Most of the big startups you know like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Snapchat, YouTube all did morally questionable things early on to corner the market (which later got revised out of history) and they started when the internet was just getting popular. \n\n3. Saas has become more popular in the YouTube business education space because no code tools have become better + chat gpt etc. However, this also means that competition has increased massively. And as an insider I can tell you that the saas wind deep in the tech world is already slowing down. People are tired of subscriptions. \n\n4. Selling saas is hard. Explaining what your software does is  not easy and it can be hard to translate the value of your software into your clients minds. Especially if they are non tech. \n\n5. Finally you have to stare at a screen everyday for a long long time. Many people underestimate this. Yes you can hire etc but you would still have to spend quite a bit of time staring into a terminal especially if your software is successful. \n\nIf you are in an area like silicon Valley with good university pedigree, joining an accelerator like YC and doing a saas is worth it. Or if you know investors and can get funding then go ahead. The playbooks are written and quite clear. Such as b2b saas for example. \n\nBut if you really like business and are interested in building the future, sell things people need. Shoes, houses, clothes, fitness, health. People will always need these things. And you don't have to sell them. They know what these things are. So you just have to tell them what's special about yours. \n\nHaving said all this if your heart tells you that programming is what you're passionate about, disregard everything I said and get going.",

            "You\u2019ll want to talk to a patent attorney to confirm and explore options. Software patents are a bit of a black hole of confusion, and leans very heavily into the legalese type maneuvering. \n\nRealistically, the paths are going to come down to:\n- don\u2019t build it\n- try to negotiate a license if you are in a different region that they are not pursuing\n- build it and wait for them to maybe send you a suit\n- in court your lawyer would either argue you have something novel or different that makes the patent not apply OR they\u2019d argue the patent is too broad and ask to court to better define the boundaries that are protected by patent\n\nSource: I am not a lawyer, I have never fought a patent, I have talked with many people about patents. \n\nTLDR; Talk to a patent attorney and define your strategy!",
            "Seek out a patent attorney.  The key to patents is nuance.  You could get a patent on a screw, for instance, that has slightly different thread pattern because that thread pattern makes the screw 0.0001% stronger, but fundamentally it looks almost identical.  You need to seek a professional opinion on how to patent your idea to make it somewhat different.  The patent might only be worth the marketing aspect or it might only be worth a shield against a potential lawsuit by your perceived competitor, but you still need to talk details with a qualified patent professional to know how much, if any, latitude you have to move within the space without infringing the other company.",
            "Personally, I would build it anyway. Just don't use their product to gather ideas for your own, and make sure you're making it your own.\n\nThere are many ways to skin a cat, and if their patent is for an algorithm a+b=c, then maybe yours is b+a=c. They can only own specific methods of doing something with a patent, but they can't own the patent on every method of obtaining a certain result. They can't own general ideas or business models, either.\n\nAnd of course, like everyone else mentioned, talk to your lawyer.",
            "From my understanding software patents do not exist, it's only Intellectual Property (IP).  \nHardware patents? Yeah. It might be BS they're just posting to scare potential up-comers.",
            "Software patents absolutely exist. And I looked up their patent at the USPTO, I wasn't just looking at their website.",
            "Considering things, like Huawei's blatant 100-100 copy of the Apple watch, to the point it's hard to distinguish it up-close, alongside the way even the software looks I wouldn't care a single smudge over a company having a supposed \"patent\". It's all obfuscated and debatable anyway.\n\nGrok states:\n\nLegal Basis: In many jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, and Japan, software can be patented if it meets certain criteria like novelty, non-obviousness, and utility. However, the specifics of what can be patented vary:  \n\n\n* U.S.: The U.S. allows patents for software if it's part of a machine or process, or if it's tied to a particular technological implementation (post-Alice Corp v. CLS Bank International case law).\n* Europe: The European Patent Office (EPO) grants patents for software that has a technical effect beyond just running on a computer.\n\nSo there's mostly hardware-based ties. IMHO, just go for it. Figure things out."

            "I\u2019d highly recommend setting up a landing page as soon as possible\u2014before the app is even fully launched. Given the growing demand, capturing early interest is crucial to building a strong user base from the start. A well-optimized landing page, combined with an email marketing strategy, can help you generate and nurture leads, ensuring that potential customers stay engaged until your product is ready.\n\nFrom my experience working with a high-growth business (outside of the medical field), I\u2019ve seen firsthand how missed lead opportunities can become a major setback. You don\u2019t want to wait until launch to start building an audience. Even if capital is a challenge, marketing now will help you test and refine your positioning, attract potential customers, and increase your chances of securing investment later. Moreover, building a waitlist of engaged users can be a strong validation point when approaching investors.\n\nWould love to hear more about your specific go-to-market strategy\u2014are you planning on direct sales (B2B outreach) or inbound marketing to drive adoption?",

Plus, those early adopters become great case studies.\n\nBubble is fine for validating your idea and getting initial traction. When you hit performance issues, that's actually a good problem - means you've found market fit.\n\nLanding page is secondary. Focus on getting 10 paying customers first. Their feedback will be worth more than any marketing spend right now."

            "Copying what I said in another sub you asked this is \n\nI created an html and css component library called CodeStitch. I came up with it a couple years ago when I was talking to my dev and designer buddies after finishing a large project. My dev friend asked if anyone had any leads or ideas on the next thing to work on and I said \u201cit would be nice if I had a little library I could browse by website sections and see the displays of website sections I made and click a button to copy and paste them into my project so I can reuse my code snippets much easier and build my websites faster\u201d and he said \u201cdude I would use this today. How much do you need?\u201d\n\n3 years ago probably $100k later we are doing pretty well with almost 4K users and 1k member discord server for freelancers and users to share their creations and get advice. We got a nice little community going go also had the same need but there wasn\u2019t anything on the market to do it for them.\n\nTheres a new tailwind component library every week. But there\u2019s not a single good HTML and CSS competent library out there with good designs and clean code. I kept trying to reuse my own code as much as possible but it was a pain finding what I want to use, opening the files up, finding the code, and integrating it into the new site. It was a hassle. But there was no tool to store my code and see a display image of what that code made so I can browse sections at a glance. And every html and css template library I found was not great\u2026 nothing I could use for a contractor or restaurant. Huge hole in the market. And now I know why. It was f**cking hard and expensive. lol and the upkeep alone. We got 2 devs working on it with me and one just transitioned to full time this week. We have ongoing design and development costs to make new templates every month. We as founder don\u2019t make any money yet from it and spend dozens of hours a week on it. Everything goes back into the business to sustain it, improve it, and grow it. Thats the thing when you found a start up. The founders are the last to get paid. We\u2019re on a good track though.\n\nI\u2019d say I\u2019m our biggest user. I use it to make all my websites now. And it\u2019s working exactly as I wanted it to when I first pitched it to my team. I love it and I\u2019m so happy I was lucky to be surrounded by people who can make my idea come to life and build it and who believed in it.",
