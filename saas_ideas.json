The problem you have is that the asset you have is: \"Relationships with executives, directors and decision makers of said industry.\" and you need to convert this asset into sales. Product development happens with the customer. You need the customer first. So you need to think about what is the minimum thing you can sell to said executives, directors, and decision makers today, or well at best literally next month. \n\nMaybe the burden of switching to your platform is too high and you need to create a plugin for their existing platform. Maybe your app vs is a Trello plugin. Maybe you need to sell it as IP-backed consulting. I don't know. But unless you know what you're selling don't bother writing a line of code.",

            "Have you done \"back of the envelope\" financial projections?  Figured out how much money you can reasonably expect to make - and compared that with the cost ($5K? $20K? $100K?) or developing your service?   Let's say you can get everything working for $50K.  Is the income going to surpass that? \n\nIf you are CERTAIN  - then:\n\n\\- Draw pictures of the APP, make a presentation, and go show it to a couple of potential customers.  Tell them you are NOT trying to sell this to them. Just wanting their input on your idea - and then ask them what it might be worth to them (monthly, yearly, whatever).  \n\n\\- Adjust your economic projections based on their answers.  Maybe you over/underestimated the value of your idea.   (And you said it is a \"local\" idea... which I assume limits it's value.  If you can re-purpose to other \"local\" areas, obviously that greatly increase the value of your service. \n\n\\- If it's still worthwhile based on above, then write up a \"technical\" document that explains exactly what the service is (page 1)... and how the software/service would work.  I.e, show every screen your users would see, and explain to the computer programer(s) exactly what each screen and each button would do.  Draw pictures and notate them with arrows to each button, etc. \n\nYour software development costs increase with complexity.  E.g.,  if you have different levels of users (Admin, super user, basic user) that is more complex than a \"stand along\" system with only one type of user.  \n\n\\- Take your tech doc and find some developers to talk to.  Their pricing will be all over the place.  Make sure they have working examples of their work that demonstrate they know how to do what you need.  (E.g. Do you need 3 types of users? Have they done something with different types of users?)   If you go to them and say \"I need this (pointing to tech doc) can you do this?)\"  - you can figure out which can or can't do the project - then ask them to give you a price and a timeline.

RESEARCH: Do some market research to confirm what features your buyers need, what pricing model would work, and what they might pay.  You could do this by taking a few people you trust out for lunches/coffee, and maybe even asking a few others you don't know as well. Also look online to see what competition you have, and what features/pricing they have.\n\n2. PLAN: Draft out a rough business/marketing plan - to make sure it'll make money, and that there's a good outline of how the product/service will work and generate revenue for you.  In this process, you can also decide how/who to fill the roles required of the business, if it's a go. \n\n3. EXECUTE: If AND ONLY IF the plan makes sense, and you're prepared to put in some effort, then you can proceed to 1) developing a brand for your product, and getting a web domain/site for it.  2) getting the money together (some of your old customers/connections might invest, or you can hit the banks, etc) and 2) contracting the programmers and building the product out.\n\n  \nMake sense?

Hire on Upwork - it's fairly simple to learn, but I doubt learning it would be the best use of your time right now.  \n\\- Talk to your connections, have them DEMO the product, ask for their honest feedback (what was confusing, what they liked, what they wish it did), ask how much time & money they saved/what they'd pay. Do *not* try to sell customers right now - feedback is infinitely more valuable at this stage than the few bucks you could get by selling customers on a half-baked product (that they'd probably leave after a few months anyway).  \n\\- Iterate product, onboarding, etc. w/ the feedback, launch a website, run some paid traffic to the website to test offer.  \n\\- Play around with different offers, audiences, etc. - see what connects.  \n\\- Onboard first few (paying) customers, use proof of concept to recruit a technical co-founder that can help you fully flesh out the product from MVP to scalable software.\n\nBest of luck, rooting for you.",
            "Let's connect! I've worked for a couple years in the construction industry and am a startup co-founder. I can help you get started! \n\nThe way forward would be to build an MVP (either a hi-fidelity figma mockup, or an actual MVP) and then show it to potential customers. Take feedback, iterate, and repeat. That's the only way to build out a SaaS. Given you relationships with decision makers, and industry-specific expertise, you can get a lot done on the none-technical side and the initial product design side.",

But at the same time if someone is ready to pay and get onboard you have a validated idea and a customer willing to pay. \n\nThings get far more clear once you an essense of budget because then you can clearly weigh between hiring someone to build or learning yourself etc.",

Find a cheap local coffee supplier and come up with a cool label and people will buy it. It\u2019s similar to wine now. \n\nIf not manufactured yourself, you can find contract manufacturers for pretty much anything. Most of the cost/value of the product is from the brand, label, IP anyway. Start a fad or following and you\u2019re in the money.\n\nFor example, celebrities (Trump, Kardashians) always put their brand names on cheaply produced products to increase value like cosmetics, alcohol, clothing, whatever. It\u2019s a goldmine for them. These are the wealthiest most successful people of our time and they just figured out how to themselves to a brand. \n\nBut other things, in the public domain, can also be brands, like politics, state and city names, popular sayings, the list is endless.",

Here are some grabs from my finds that might inspire you:\n\n**1. Virtual Wrench**  \nGot a car issue? Who needs to get greasy when a virtual mechanic can diagnose issues in their PJs?\n\n**Why now?:** The gig economy is thriving, and with platforms like JustAnswer booming, this innovative idea taps into a very lucrative and growing $500 billion gig economy market.\n\n**2. Real Estate Crowdfunding Platform**  \nTurning every couch potato into a landlord without the hassle! Crowdfunding as an option for those who want to brag about their real estate prowess without actually doing anything.\n\n**Why now?:** Given the inflationary environment and increasing interest in real estate as a hedge, collective investing platforms are gaining attention. The global real estate crowdfunding market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 58% by 2028.\n\n**3. EcoInsurance**  \nInsurance that actually wants to save the planet, rather than just ignoring it.\n\n**Why now?:** With biodiversity and climate crises looming, companies are starting to realize that eco-friendly is not just cool, it's necessary. Particularly with $20 billion annually needed to combat biodiversity loss globally.\n\n**4. Deepfake Defence Force**  \nProtect the world from cyber-fakes with a SaaS solution detecting AI-driven deepfakes. It's like having your personal Sherlock Holmes, but for the digital age.\n\n**Why now?:** Internet scams leveraging deepfake technology are on the rise, taking advantage of increasingly sophisticated AI tools to deceive people on a massive scale.\n\n**5. AI Powered Restaurant Management System**  \nWhy rely on humans when AI can handle restaurant operations? Revolutionize dining experiences with a digital butler.\n\n**Why now?:** Post-pandemic, restaurants are embracing tech like never before. The global market for restaurant management software is set to grow by 14.3% annually.\n\n**6. Single Parent Match**\n\nThis dating app is specially designed for single parents juggling kids, work, and finding love. Because you shouldn\u2019t have to choose between finding a soulmate and finding a babysitter!\n\n**Why Now?**: The single parent population is growing rapidly, with over 11 million single parent families in the US alone. Traditional dating apps often overlook the unique needs and challenges faced by single parents.\n\n**7. Digital Safe space for Teens**  \nCreate a digital platform offering safe, moderated chat rooms and forums where teens can discuss mental health, academic pressures, and everyday challenges anonymously. Picture a space where teens can vent, share memes, and get support without worrying about trolls or oversharing.\n\n**Why Now?**: The mental health of young people has been significantly impacted by the pandemic, with rising rates of anxiety, low mood, and self-harm. A digital safe space can provide crucial support outside of school hours .\n\n**News Trigger**: Antidepressant use in child mental health services increased by 44% in the last decade",

Additionally, B2B selling is even more challenging. You can create a great product, but unless people trust that you know what you\u2019re talking about, selling it will be very difficult.

At 21 you'd better believe I was stoked. It was the first glimpse I had of it actually being possible to earn a living doing something I love. \n\nI continued to run a small web hosting service and take on one-off coding requests form clients. Almost all of which went on my resume. As someone who didn't finish college, I needed all of the experience I could get. A couple of years later, a small company reached out to me, through monster.com (god I'm old, lol). I've been with the same company for almost two decades now, and I couldn't imagine doing anything else. \n\nAll because of some project that I cooked up over a summer.

            "In my limited time bootstrapping my own stuff, I raise a glass to your list.\n\nMy version:\n\n* **B2B > B2C** (except if you've some specialized unserved niche that you can have an app up and running in a few days and are willing to just gamble).\n* **No VC** - I haven't done VC, but hear horror stories. One interview I heard yesterday said, if you make a $2M business as a bootstrapped company you're a success. But in VC you need to get to $100M. However, how many businesses can get to a $100M valuation. You're setting yourself up for failure.\n* **Nail outreach** - distribution will make or break you. Outreach + no product = pre sell product. Product + no outreach = no sales.\n* **Yes to SEO & Content; No to relying on it 100%** - Google is seriously monkeying with search results. So you need SEO and content, but make sure you have other avenues as well.\n* **Piggyback off other traffic sources** - Reddit, Pintrest, Quora, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, etc. Know them. Love them.\n* **The Time Investment to Validation Ratio** - the longer it will take to build something, the longer you should take to validate it. If you can get it up in a weekend or a week, then you can risk less validation.\n* **Off the shelf as much as possible** - At the beginning you have no idea if your project will work. So it's easier to start with a $199 boilerplate than spend 3 months reinventing the wheel. Use as many off the shelf and free tools as you can. Google Forms are your friend. You can even create signable documents in JotForm for free.\n* **Tiny MVP:** I know so many successful projects that started out as a Excel or Google sheet. Start with the minimum minimum viable product. Try to not code at all until you have paying customers.\n* **The \"Jay Leno\" approach** - If at all possible have a day job. When your project gets traction, then jump to it. Jay Leno said he's never lived off his tonight show money. He lives off the earnings from his stand up gigs. I've seen a lot of successful projects that were helped by this model.\n* **Either people buy your product/service or they don't** - You'll get so many \"that's a great idea\" or \"I'd be open to using your service in 6 months when you launch\" or \"I love this, let me talk to my boss\" or \"this could be a great partnership for us where we can send you a lot of business let's spend the next 6 months working out a deal\" or \"how about we use your service for an equity deal in our company that hasn't made any money yet\". Farts in the wind. Cash in hand is the ultimate validation.\n* **Research, Research:** Look up how much competition you'll have on Google. Find a successful business model to copy and ask what are their traffic sources and how long have they been successful. Understand your market.\n* **The Long Haul:** Something may be a great idea, that serves a market, that's validated, that's easy to build, but ... do you want to work on this idea and promote it for the next 3-5 years? Launching is one thing. Continuing to put effort into it is a whole other challenge.\n* **Sunk Cost Quicksand:** It's very hard to kill a project after you've put years into it. I've been working on a site for 2 years with zero monetary returns. Currently I'm transitioning it to a more passive model and will let it just exist. But it's very hard not to want to put more effort into it when I know it could have potential. One developer says if you haven't made any money with it in 3 to 6 months, you should probably kill it. However, I know a project that's currently making $70K MRR but it took them 3 years to get to $1K MRR. So it's a tricky balance to know if you're being persistent or being a fool.\n* **Get to Money Sooner:** Big funded companies can afford to exist in the red for years (or a decade), but most of us have limited money, time, and effort. The faster you can get a project, website, business to cash, they sooner you'll know you have traction.\n* **Some other lessons:** [https://twitter.com/adamdenverco/highlights](https://twitter.com/adamdenverco/highlights)",

            "Good post OP. I just have a nit pick.\n\n> Today I have 1 fullstack dev doing 5x more progress on a project than a team of 12 back then. Avoid \"teams\" at all costs.\n\n30+ year Senior Dev here (who's also started and worked for startups). I retired earlier this year, but they just pulled me back in. Probably the most well known project I worked on was Apple's iCloud for instance. I wrote the load balancer they used to scale the huge Exabyte storage needs they had.\n\nYou probably have a really good fullstack dev. Or your apps are pretty simple. But at the end of the day it's impossible to have expertise in everything. Tech is just too complex for that. A person who keeps up with all the Front end madness that is happening (React, Svelte, TypeScript, node...) cannot possibly also be at the cutting edge about infrastructure the way a DevOps Engineer can. A guy writing front end will not be able to maintain a complex Kubernetes Operator in Go at the same time.\n\nThere is just too much context switching. And vice-versa, a DevOps guy isn't going to be great at front end design. Sure they can do it, but it will take 3 times longer and it won't look quite right.\n\nI'm sorry but that's just not a thing. In development pretty much every area is constantly evolving, and you have to keep up with it. No single person can really keep up with everything. \n\nIt just sounds like your businesses needed more front end guys, and you were hiring the wrong people for the job. Likely outsourcing difficult scaling back-end issues to other IaaS/SaaS providers.\n\nThough I do agree, 1 bad ass can outwork a team of 5 for sure. Hope you're paying your guy well.",

            "Literally LOL'd at #15, because I've been that corporate drone being rewarded as a perk.\n\nOn #16. I don't think it is fair to say Scrum itself is a scam.  I agree with your premise though....because most of the people selling their expertise in it are scamming companies. Real Scrum was supposed to be a set of tools on top of what you described -- hiring grown ups to do the work and let them manage themselves. But everybody just cargo-cults the terminology and continues the old school top-down management approach under the covers.\n\nMy biggest regret is putting off quitting my 9-5 and getting started for so long. Now that we're going, my fears about failure and lost income opportunity from quitting my 9-5 don't seem so bad. Instead of the blocker they were before, they kind of became a motivator because I do need income, and now my business is the path I'm on to get it.",
            "Wow, this is point for point what should be sent to the founder of the startup I was a part of that just collapsed lmao",
            "That is a great list! I haven't agreed this hard with a list in years.\n\nI would add the following, from my experience:\n\n1. **Never add to your feature list in front of outsiders.** I've been in so many meetings with investors or customers where someone daydreams a crazy new feature and the founders say something along the lines of: \"Oh, that's brilliant! We'll do that for sure!\" At that point, I'd say the venture has a 10% chance of survival. Never commit to an idea you haven't fully explored, not just in terms of the effort required, but the cost of distracting you from your original goals. The second you say \"yes\" to an idea in front of an outsider, that idea is *all* they will ever ask about, and a failure to deliver it will outweigh anything else you do.\n2. **Pivot with purpose.** If, during validation, several people tell you you're missing the mark, then you probably need to pivot. I've seen founders dig in their heels and refuse to adapt, often using a variation of: \"We'll prove them wrong.\" You probably won't. But at the same time, don't pivot too easily (or often), because being a weather vane means you'll end up pleasing no one, and never be able to reach any of your (likely numerous, disparate) milestones.\n3. **Hammer salesmen will always see nails.** Hiring outsiders and consultants is generally risky, but if you do, do not fall for their tunnel vision. The second you bring in a consultant, they are going to try to upsell you. Need help with a devops problem? They'll spot a thousand inefficiencies that also need fixing. Need help with a marketing issue? They'll find a thousand things you are doing wrong that are stunting your growth. It's not that they're *wrong*, but they aren't there to see you succeed, they're there to maximize their earnings. They will be very convincing and hard to resist, but you need to have clear specs at the outset: fix this problem, and that's it. \n4. **Always. Communicate. Internally.** Full disclosure between the core team is absolutely essential. Report back important details the second they happen. Text the group on the way back from the meeting. Voice worries after a rough night of no sleep. Flag slippage that you can feel but not quantify yet. The team only works as a team if everyone has all the information, good or bad. Siloing information leads to inefficiencies at best, and Game of Thrones-type paranoia and plotting at worst. It's amazing how many startups implode because someone was afraid to share some bad news, one time, and it spiralled out of control.\n5. **Don't buy toys.** If you get funding of any kind, do not buy yourself the latest *whatevers* unless you really truly need them. An impressive workspace will charm investors to an extent, but at some point they will start to suspect you're spending all your time window shopping and not working, and the core trust in your competency starts to erode in unfixable ways. Buy toys with revenue, not other people's money.",
            "Your biggest mistake was launching 30 startups in 20 years.  Amazon didn't make a profit for 10 years.  Tesla needed 17.  I joined a company as employee #10.  7 years later it sold for $100 million.  It also took years to make a profit and it took a leadership team entirely focused on building a great product rather than building something they could flip.",
            "John, I might add: \n\n* **Thinking you need a lot of money to start a venture**\n* **Not seeking a co-founder:** mainly for the emotional load of creating a company\n* **Underestimating the importance of cybersecurity:** Many founders struggle with cyberattacks. \n* **Pivoting too late:** The business landscape can change rapidly. Startups need to be able to pivot and adjust their strategies as needed.\n* **Focusing solely on growth hacking:** While user acquisition is important, neglecting long-term customer retention and satisfaction can be detrimental.\n* **Not focusing in marketing:** while having a great product is important, distribution must be considered.",

I suggest you seek to understand it, its aim is literally what you cite as its weakness.\n\nThere are too many scammers and pretend experts out there out there who lead to people having your view but scrum is NOT a scam.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a startup and high functioning, there\u2019s a 90% chance you are agile.\n\nI\u2019d love to understand why you think that though. I\u2019ve used it to make drastic, positive change and I\u2019m constantly fighting the attitude that thinks what is being asked is to standup every day and sit through pointless meetings.",
            "As a specialized developer I'll chime in about points 10,16 and 19.\n\n10. I agree with this at the start. Specialists are there to optimize their specialty. They are great if you have a team and each member or pairs of members are responsible for a different part. But when you first start out a generalist will most likely be able to get an MVP out faster. The downside can be that it won't scale as well, but that's a problem for after you've gotten some customers. And that's the problem specialists should come in for; after you already have an MVP and some momentum so now you need them to polish or add new features to your product. \n\n16. Scrum is meant for large organizations that have a lot of bureaucracy. It doesn't usually make sense in a small company. The whole point of scrum is to make sure everyone is communicating and to address any blockers someone is having. It's meant for quick iterations on a product in an otherwise slow environment. If you only have 3 developers that work together every day, there's 0 point in trying to formalize a scrum process or hire a scrum master. The only way this might work for a smaller team/company is if different people are working on different parts in a vacuum. Then, yeah sure, every day or every other day have a quick 15 minute \"check-in\" to give each other updates. But again, if your teams are already communicating well, this is irrelevant.  Scrum is to software development what Six Sigma is to manufacturing; they're both meant to increase effectiveness of your resources by implementing feedback mechanisms and processes. But if you already have good processes, all they'll do is clog up your existing system. \n\n19. For MVPs, yeah, use whatever pre-built stuff you can get that'll work. There's no reason to re-invent the wheel and coding from scratch can be a lot of unnecessary work for some things.",

            "I wish I had read this list before my startup. I committed a lot of the same mistakes as you as well. The tech conferences is a good one - you\u2019d think you go there to meet a lot of investors and other startup founders you can align with, which is both rarely the case",
            "Number 7 - skipping idea validation. Was my biggest - build and they will come strategy is massively flawed.  At the beginning this is where most of founder energy needs to be placed.",
            "Great post OP. \nME with 13 startups in the past 35 years. Several paid big, most get shuttered within 2 years. Held many titles doing many different jobs before engaging in startups, that helped. I smiled at #4, #5 & #6, having dodged those. Even doing hardware projects I agree wholly on #1 however.. having sold a line of consumer products in giant volumes netted that startup a huge valuation and payoff. Marketing to consumers is fickle. Big risk big reward. #8 is gold, they have no place in a startup, nor exec positions that aren\u2019t actual Doers, no time nor funds for overhead, even if your account says ok. #9 is also gold as I\u2019ve wasted SO much time and energy on wasted BC meetings where they barely paid attention and offered so little while demanding so much. Likewise the current fuss over Scrum is largely blather, hire solid people and manage deadlines. \n\nAnd finally, my apologies for your losses on #20, for as an entrepreneur I took off time for Every Little League practice, soccer practice, ballet recitals, track meets and ANYTHING that my kids were doing came first , then back to the office after dinner and bedtime stories. \n\nSome startups failed but I got to be there for my kids. Priceless.",
            "not having discipline and organization and understanding of business and not like being serious about it, and especially not having deadlines well more so tracking progress. I am back on track and focused now.  I actually like that you said scrum is a scam. it makes sense, because you just need to get to point A to point B, you dont need to scrum, when you can just go to point A to point B simply, much like driving, you dont need a GPS but its useful, but knowing your roads and how to \"find your way\" is most important. so i wasted time trying scrum and so on as well. last realization i notice is prioritizing the wrong things.",
            "I like this list a lot except for #16.  Scrum is a philosophy and methodology that has had enormous impact on software development.  What method do you suggest then? Waterfall? Cleanroom? Spiral? Prototyping?  Your criticism makes me wonder if you are not actually critical of Scrum but of poorly implemented Scrum.",
            "Good point about scrum. If ppl aren\u2019t proactive and working on creating value then they shouldn\u2019t be there.",
            "Scrum is definitely a scam.  I do quibble with taking VC money though.  The better thing is to take any kind of investor money, VC or otherwise, to scale or grow rather than develop.  \n\nAI for instance has been an R&D problem for the last 50 years and no one has wanted to fund it except Darpa and Google. But now that it's a scale and tuning problem VCs can't seem to throw enough money at it."

            "I\u2019d highly recommend setting up a landing page as soon as possible\u2014before the app is even fully launched. Given the growing demand, capturing early interest is crucial to building a strong user base from the start. A well-optimized landing page, combined with an email marketing strategy, can help you generate and nurture leads, ensuring that potential customers stay engaged until your product is ready.\n\nFrom my experience working with a high-growth business (outside of the medical field), I\u2019ve seen firsthand how missed lead opportunities can become a major setback. You don\u2019t want to wait until launch to start building an audience. Even if capital is a challenge, marketing now will help you test and refine your positioning, attract potential customers, and increase your chances of securing investment later. Moreover, building a waitlist of engaged users can be a strong validation point when approaching investors.\n\nWould love to hear more about your specific go-to-market strategy\u2014are you planning on direct sales (B2B outreach) or inbound marketing to drive adoption?",
            "Start small and local. Face-to-face with medical businesses will give you real feedback and help perfect the product before scaling. Plus, those early adopters become great case studies.\n\nBubble is fine for validating your idea and getting initial traction. When you hit performance issues, that's actually a good problem - means you've found market fit.\n\nLanding page is secondary. Focus on getting 10 paying customers first. Their feedback will be worth more than any marketing spend right now."

I've subscribed to one myself and it's a pretty decent one and here are my 2 cents based on a paid subscription to a business ideas subscription.\n\nYou need 3 tests for an idea to really bootstrap an idea successfully:\n\n1. I**s there demand for this solution? is this addressing a burning pain?** in this case it's not. I agree with the fact that there is room for custom forms and that's why there are too many solutions. But the big question is are they profitable? There are some people looking for custom solutions but are they big enough a market for building a custom product? Are they all looking for the same solution or they are asking for very high customization?\n\n**2. Can I build and sell this solution?** building it would be easy, but selling it would be tough. First of all, OP admits it's a crowded market. And some of the players are funded. If you are competing with funded players for marketing space, we all know the outcome (look at Uber Vs Taxi industry, Airbnb vs individual hotel owners)\n\n**3. Am I interested in creating this?** well, in case you are trying to build something from an idea subscription, you have to wait in a never ending queue to see something you are really passionate about. That's my opinion from the subscription.\n\nI've never seen anyone in my life who failed in a business and admitted that they failed because their idea sucked (including myself). The reason is when people come up with an idea themselves, they would find a ton of different excuses except for the fact that the idea sucked. People have that conviction about an idea because it's original. But will they be able to build something and have equal conviction in case of borrow-and-build approach?",

It's a really tough market to break into. Currently we're trying to niche towards developers by providing APIs for data retrieval. We also explicitly avoid 'form builders' because a developer has to style everything on their side anyways and that just gets in the way. I'll go through and outline our response to the 'chops' you laid out.\n\n**Unique niche**\n\nDevelopers. Insanely easy setup that connects you to the rest of your workflow. APIs.\n\n**Tech Chops**\n\nOur tech stack is just javascript all the way down. We use express, nuxt, vue, and... that's pretty much it. We deploy all our stuff on AWS and each of our actions (taken per submission) is its own lambda behind a simple queue. Our costs are fairly high, but it's very cheap to scale once we need to, plus [we got a bunch of AWS credits](https://formcake.com/blog/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits) which should keep us going through the rest of next year.\n\n**Marketing Chops**\n\nWe focused on the long tail blogging strategy and haven't focused on driving traffic except through that yet. Partly because we wanted to spend most of this year making sure our tech was solid without the pressure of too many annoyed users. Now that we feel really solid there we're starting to push on more active marketing efforts. This probably wasn't the best idea and we should have been pushing harder on it from the start but... marketing is hard!\n\n**Cost Analysis**\n\nWe're running WAY over the cost you quoted. We could have built it on a cheaper stack but since we wanted to build for scale we over-engineered a bit. This isn't the fastest path to market but I hope it will pay off for us in the long run.",

A good example that I have come across is My AI Front Desk where you can just rebrand their AI-powered customer service solution and start offering it to businesses right away, without having to worry about any coding or technical setup. A lot of white-label SaaS providers give you some flexibility when it comes to ownership and control. If you ever want to switch things up or customize the software more, they can give you options for that. It\u2019s a perfect solution if you want to get started quickly and focus on marketing and sales while using a product that's already up and running."

Many of your competitors have 5 stars with 50+ reviews.  What's the main reason for the lower reviews with your companies?  \n\nPlease don't take this as any knock on you or your businesses. I just think that most of us see you as the gold standard for service businesses and if this is an area you are struggling with it would be really difficult for those of us looking to start.

            "Getting a few reports on this so I thought I would recognize the issues raised and make sure everyone knows what is going on.\n\n**Reports about self-promotion and spam:** u/localcasestudy owns launch27.com and Groovehiring which he points out.  These sites provide services for service booking businesses. When you read his posts please keep in mind he does have cause to favor it - but he also points that out himself (\"...if we do say so ourselves..\"). People doing AMAs are allowed to provide a modest number of links to their company if it is material to their AMA which certainly seems to be the case here. Given that guideline, given that there are no affiliate links in the OP and given the relative amount of information to links I don't think the post would qualify as spam, particularly given ongoing involvement in Q&A. One other concern might be if the video content were all self-promotional. I will be reviewing the videos shortly but given the titles/descriptions I don't expect them to be simply cloaked sales pitches for real information.\n\n**One report was for threatening and harassing.** There doesn't seem to be anything like that in the OP. If you were serious about this report please contact the mods. If a comment was harassing please report that specific comment so we can investigate. \"Harassing\" means attacks on you as a person it does not mean saying something you disagree with or attacking your concepts, thoughts or position on issues. Criticism is fair game. Name-calling or worse is not. We take these type of reports very seriously but reporting something as threatening to try to raise alarm level when it is not is just as serious. Only use this type of report if you are being harassed or threatened.\n\n\n---\nEdit: So this post explaining why I did what I did has now been reported as \"Mod team are shills\" and \"Fucking stupid.\" Everyone is free to respond to this post and point out why I am wrong. I listen to that and consider it. If you make a solid case I will change my position on things. It is important to me to be logical and rational and that means recognizing I can be wrong. \n\n---\nEdit: I'm asking the other mods to take a look and review the post to find out if I was in error making this a sticky as an AMA and to make sure I am not being biased in evaluating the reports. I would much prefer a discussion of why people see this as an ad rather than an AMA (yes, I do understand the formatting suggests ad and the phrasing feels marketing but when I drill down to look at how much is actually promotion I see promotion of a concept rather than a service. Haven't reviewed the videos yet though.) Please tell me how I am wrong. I will be reviewing the back and forth both in this post and others.\n\n---\nEdit: So a fair number of the reports seem to be saying it is improper to have this stickied. One asked how much I was paid to sticky it (nothing incidentally, I thought it would qualify to be stickied under our past AMA guidelines). Since that was just my call and since I've asked the broader mod team to review it I will be unstickying it until they do so and decide how to go. **Was it a mistake for me to sticky it? I think so but not for the reasons you might think.** I think it was acceptable to do so under our policies for AMAs but I don't think that it helped the community. The post was already visible to everyone because of the supporting upvotes it had received. Stickying it just pissed off people who didn't want to see it. I didn't see that coming and apologize for missing it and doing the wrong thing. Trying to help and failed. Sorry",

If an anonymous entrepreneur came in and gave the same recommendations, they'd be just as valid as this guy's. He tells you he owns it - he tells you he recommends it - because he believes in it. This isn't snake oil and hair tonic; you have every opportunity to do your own research and validate. Are you offended that he recommended Stripe.com instead of PayPal or Square?

            "Hey everyone, since this is a thread about starting new business I thought I may ask here instead of starting new thread. I hope that's okay.\nAbout two weeks ago I've finally decided to start my own company. I am a backend web developer with 5 years of experience. I do feel confident enough to start my own company, when it comes to skills. Speaking of business side of this idea, I've been reading a lot for the last couple of years. Also my wife has been tremendously helpful, always pointing out things I've missed or had wrong idea about. I've written my business plan, and I know who do I want to target. Taking advantage of the fact, that the city where I live is full of tech startups - I want to reach out to those entrepreneurs and offer them help with backend of their services/ mobile and web applications/ automation/ API's and server side. I am experienced with recent technologies, frameworks and trends in this area, so I'm sure I can provide a satisfactory service to my potential customers. The only thing I am not quite sure of as for now is how to reach these companies. I live in Hong Kong, and websites as YELP, Craiglist and others are not really popular here. Also, I can imagine that advertising B2B is very different from B2C advertisement. I've found this website, listing most recent and trending startups in here, and I was thinking about sending them emails with an offer? I am surely going to attend numerous entrepreneur meetups and conferences. I have a website and business cards. I have so many questions and I do not expect you guys to answer all of them, but I hope I can get some advice and/or tips on how to get into that field as a one-man suit company? I am not excluding possibility of collaborating with one of my front-end web designers friends, to be able to offer a wider variety of services, however I mostly want to focus on a back end side, as that is my specialty, and something I feel most familiar with...\n\nThank you a lot!\n",

Or do you always go with teams of 2?\n3 - biggest operation challenge for me (after managing staff) is travel. My city is massive, easily 30 miles across and we have some heavy snowfall sometimes.

We hired two mechanics full-time who have been with us for 6 months. Things were going smoothly with both steady increase in demand & operationally very good feedback on the service we provided.\n\nThen recently we started seeing demand for waterless car wash. So we added this as part of our service and saw demand really shooting skywards. The mechanics were temporarily taking care of the cleaning until we hired full time cleaners.\nThen suddenly both our mechanics vanished along with the entire toolkit & supplies. Customers got pissed off, we weren't able to find cleaners quickly enough and had to pause all services for a few weeks.\n\nWe are going back online with a new hiring strategy. Outsourcing our cleaning staff to an agency. Outsourced staff will be trained by us and use our supplies. If any of the staff leaves, the agency immediately assigns a new person. Since it is a low skill job and the kind of supplies used make us unique, hoping this strategy works in the long run.\n\nOn the mechanic side, we have improved our candidate selection process and offering better incentives for a minimum duration of employment.\n\nThe biggest lesson we have learnt through all of this is always prepare for churn.",

            "Validation means different things to different people.  But generally speaking show the product to as many people as possible and then get feedback.  Sometimes you can also do general research to know if in fact that there is a demand in an industry.  Sometimes its much more difficult to tell and you have to do alot more customer feedback and validation sessions.",
            "Hi,\n\nMaking sure your B2B SaaS idea is good before you start building it is really important. It can help you save time and money. You wonder if you\u2019re being too careful by not talking to people until you have something to show, but I personally think getting feedback early can actually be super helpful. \n\nIf you talk to a few people you trust, they can give you good advice without you feeling like you\u2019re using up your contacts. Just let them know you\u2019re looking for feedback, not trying to sell them anything.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about reaching out to people you don\u2019t know to get their thoughts, that can work too. You can make a quick survey or talk to people to see if your idea makes sense to them. \n\nYou can also try some other ways to check or see if your idea is good. \n\nFor example, you can make a simple web page that explains your idea and see if people sign up for updates. This can show you if people are interested. If you have time, making a basic version of your tool can help you get feedback. There are tools that let you make a simple version of your software without needing to actually code it.\n\nRemember, this advice is coming from someone who\u2019s really good at launching Private Label (PL) products on Amazon. So if you want more information about PL, just let me know!\n\nThanks",
            "You're not being too cautious. Your network is valuable, and you're right to save it for when you have something concrete to show. Don't burn those connections on early-stage validation.\n\nCold outreach can work for idea validation, but it's not great. Here's a better approach:\n\n   - Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find people matching your ICP. Send InMails (not DMs).\n   - Export that list to a tool like Apollo or RevenueBase to get their email addresses.\n   - Clean the list with Reoon to remove bad emails.\n   - Use an email outreach tool like Smartlead to send personalized cold emails.\n   - Keep your daily send volume under 30 per email address for good deliverability.\n   - Offer something valuable in exchange for their time (industry insights, gift card, etc.)\n\nYou don't need hundreds of responses. Even 20-30 good conversations can provide solid validation. Once you have a demo, then leverage your network for real deals.\n\nSource: I run a B2B email outreach agency (OutreachBloom)"

At the moment I'm a product manager, using a combination of AI, automation, and low code/headless cms tools to scale processes or to make them more efficient. I love the application of the tech in complete solutions more than just living on the bleeding edge of AI technology.\n\nMy background is systems engineering, which is just the idea of treating your entire business or domain as a system of systems that are interconnected. AI isn't a tool that solves all problems, but can be deployed in components of the business. Being able to conceptually understand a business's needs combined with understanding what AI tools are out there I think is a nice intersection.\n\nI was considering that it might be possible to focus on local businesses as well in areas that aren't particularly tied into the latest emerging technology.",

For AI to realize its potential, the technology would need to get democratized. Curious if anyone here has thoughts on the utility of being able to automate document workflows (take data in from one or more sources, process it however relevant with AI and place at precisely controlled target locations on deliverables). Would a no-code tool that could do something like that help these small businesses and proprietors?",

I have been looking for the past week to give this AAA model a try, however I am slightly worried of selling a product to a costumer that could compromise the privacy of the data gathered. For instance, I wanted to create a telegrambot for real state agents within my city to help them schedule visits. However, since ppl would have to give their phone number for that, I fear that using Botpress and Zapier could mean that their data gets leaked if there is a breach one day. Also, I fear services such as the ones mentioned, to close and having to interrupt my services because of that. Could you shed some light on how do you deal with that?\n\nOn another note, is it possible to program a Bot like this ones from scratch, running on our own servers so that the data doens't get to the public, but I guess that the data would be leaked eitherway anytime the OpenAI API is called, right?",

You can even do it for free by using personal email addresses until the project takes off.\n- anything technical (user auth, db, whatever) using the native solution from the cloud vendor is my go to. I.e I wouldn\u2019t want any technical decisions made for me. You can get pretty far even with the free tier, especially if you choose serverless technologies\n\nI like where your head is at.

I joined your course a month ago on Udemy and I found that your teachings are awesome.\n\nI am also interested in web technology and now I'm learning PHP and MySQL to get solid foundation of programming. I like WordPress a lot and I hope to be a WP developer.",
            "Really like your approach here, with both of your apps! \n\nIt's great to see you sorting through which feedback to take on board e.g you iterated quickly on your script because you got a lot of requests for it - but you haven't been swayed to reduce your price because (and I agree) it's a fair price for those that need your podcast management. \n\nIt can be tough to know who/what to believe but you seem to know your own mind and have a great deal of focus. Also sharing your methods has resulted in you validating the need for another paid product which is a bonus! :)\n\nRegarding your price - I think $29 pcm is fine - if you do a weekly podcast and podigniter saves you an hour+ of time then that's well worth $7.50 - it can even add revenue to your bottom line when it remembers to bill sponsors on time! \n\nAs a pair of fresh eyes I have a few initial points of feedback - \n\n* **Branding Emphasis Needed**  The name (or a logo) needs to be more prominent to be memorable - if people try to re-visit at a later date as you add features they will have a hard time remembering your name & are unlikely to currently find you through search. \n* **Clarify Your Headline** - The phrase 'on top of' feels a little vague. 'Organize' or 'Automate Repetitive Tasks' are more powerful - your target market will identify with feeling unorganised or having to regularly do tasks manually\n* **Your Audience Is Split** - You have 2 very distinct markets, new & established podcasters. Brand new podcasters don't yet know the pain of podcast administrivia & may not instantly see the value. They don't yet have sponsors so signing up to any paid product pulls them further away from profitability. This crowd will tell you your product is 'expensive' when it's not. Established podcasters with high paying sponsors would probably pay 10x your price but may be too set in their ways to move over to a new service. They may demand more features as they attempt to completely replicate what they do themselves. If you're aiming for 'easy to use' avoid adding everything they ask for. Be mindful of which audience you are writing your copy for. \n* **Social Proof** - Getting some known podcasts using this service would a huge credibility indicator if you could put their logo on your site. Their mentions would be great advertising at $0/little cost.\n\nI know it's early days & you may have all of these ideas & possibilities in mind anyway - write them all down & any one you find yourself writing down multiple times are obviously have recurring needs. \n\nLooking forward to hearing how it progresses for you over the coming months!

Two of the products that I created (1st one made $150k lifetime and second one made $350k lifetime) I was a participant and I solved a personal problem and provided it as a service. \n\nI also started an e-commerce business which did close to $1m in gmv by purely being early. 18 months down the line the market was saturated and I couldn't turn a profit, I had to shut it down.",
            "Thanks for the insight. It was an interesting read.\n\nI actually agree with you when you talk about finding a product that solves the problem, if there is a market for it then it's probably one of those businesses that could explode. My question would be related to supply, you spoke about how your friend wanted those hoodie blankets so there must have already been people who sell those products otherwise they wouldn't have thought about buying it. So my questions are:\n\n1. How saturated was the market when you started your business?\n2. What was the key differentiator between your product and the competitors that made the business work?\n3. How did you source the product?\n\nIf you don't mind sharing your answers for those, it would be a great learning point for me as an aspiring entrepreneur.",

Restaurants, landscaping, heck even vacuum\u2019s. \n\nCompetition is GOOD. It means the idea works, and you can make a metric ton of money by thinking of not something new to do, but how to do something better. \n\nYou\u2019ll also save a ton of time as you won\u2019t be spending it on your own half-baked ideas.",

            "Decent general advice, curious what your net take home is? Monetizing online, especially social media endeavors, are extremely high risk, you are beholden to the corporate whims of the platforms and more and more the political whims of our society.  \n\nSo you had a good year thus far based on your gross revenue but call it what it is, you are dropshipping, a middleman store front.  What's your plan to sustain this? \n\nThe Comfys or whatever you bought and sold for a markup were a fad, can you keep guessing the trends? \n\nright now you are nothing more than a middle man marking up the \"hit\"  merchandise, what value do you actually produce? You are not inventing the products, producing them, improving upon them, owning real estate to allow people to provide goods and services. \n\nAgain some good wisdom in your post but your model is unlikely to last for a career, having an online front and being a middle man dropshipping is already overdone and saturated.  Markup on average is about 10% to a high of 20% so if you have really low expenses and a markup on the higher end, your net revenue is ballpark, 75k to 140k not including costs, website, marketing, POS, cc fees etc.... \n\nBe surprised if after all is said and done you pierced 100k take home. I love a good discourse tho, prove me wrong.",

            "Ah, the perfect startup recipe: no code, no money, no business plan, no customers. You're essentially a stealth mode startup so stealthy, even you don't know what you're doing next. Congratulations, you've achieved ninja level in entrepreneurial mystery!",
            "The entrepreneurial bug has bitten you. Welcome to the SaaS dream. A couple of problems you may run into early that I want to warn you about:\n\nYour product development overhead may be low but you'll have to deal with customer support, bug fixes, deployment issues, server cost if your product does well, marketing etc.\n\nWhen you hire a developer or a team of developers, you need to retain them for the long term. You're product is going to go through many different iterations before you find product market fit and the speed at which you need to iterate in order to capture the market needs to be there. This will cost you more than having a technical cofounder.\n\nFinding a developer is easy. Finding a good developer is hard. Finding a good developer who cares enough about the product to move fast enough...\n\nSaas isn't going anywhere. With the help of no code tools and AI, you can build an MVP and validate your idea. And you can learn how to code and build out your project at the same time.\n\nGood luck to you",
            "Yep, come up with some ideas, test them all out by seeing if anyone is interested. Get a list of users that are interested and find a way to connect with people to pitch to them. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to know how to code, honestly that will delay you more.",
            "I come from a software background. And I'll give some counter intuitive ideas here I have learnt the hard way. \n\n1. With saas and software it is very easy for someone to copy you and build what you have so unless you really have a technical advantage, most saas businesses are not successful. \n\n2. You need to catch a wave + do something naughty. Most of the big startups you know like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Snapchat, YouTube all did morally questionable things early on to corner the market (which later got revised out of history) and they started when the internet was just getting popular. \n\n3. Saas has become more popular in the YouTube business education space because no code tools have become better + chat gpt etc. However, this also means that competition has increased massively. And as an insider I can tell you that the saas wind deep in the tech world is already slowing down. People are tired of subscriptions. \n\n4. Selling saas is hard. Explaining what your software does is  not easy and it can be hard to translate the value of your software into your clients minds. Especially if they are non tech. \n\n5. Finally you have to stare at a screen everyday for a long long time. Many people underestimate this. Yes you can hire etc but you would still have to spend quite a bit of time staring into a terminal especially if your software is successful. \n\nIf you are in an area like silicon Valley with good university pedigree, joining an accelerator like YC and doing a saas is worth it. Or if you know investors and can get funding then go ahead. The playbooks are written and quite clear. Such as b2b saas for example. \n\nBut if you really like business and are interested in building the future, sell things people need. Shoes, houses, clothes, fitness, health. People will always need these things. And you don't have to sell them. They know what these things are. So you just have to tell them what's special about yours. \n\nHaving said all this if your heart tells you that programming is what you're passionate about, disregard everything I said and get going.",

It allows you to provide valuable software solutions to customers without the need for them to manage installations and updates, which enhances user experience and retention. Additionally, the market for SaaS is continually growing as businesses seek more efficient and cost-effective tools to manage their operations. However, it also requires substantial initial investment in development and ongoing costs for maintaining and improving the service. Success in the SaaS space often hinges on addressing a specific niche or problem effectively and offering excellent customer support."

            "Copying what I said in another sub you asked this is \n\nI created an html and css component library called CodeStitch. I came up with it a couple years ago when I was talking to my dev and designer buddies after finishing a large project. My dev friend asked if anyone had any leads or ideas on the next thing to work on and I said \u201cit would be nice if I had a little library I could browse by website sections and see the displays of website sections I made and click a button to copy and paste them into my project so I can reuse my code snippets much easier and build my websites faster\u201d and he said \u201cdude I would use this today. How much do you need?\u201d\n\n3 years ago probably $100k later we are doing pretty well with almost 4K users and 1k member discord server for freelancers and users to share their creations and get advice. We got a nice little community going go also had the same need but there wasn\u2019t anything on the market to do it for them.\n\nTheres a new tailwind component library every week. But there\u2019s not a single good HTML and CSS competent library out there with good designs and clean code. I kept trying to reuse my own code as much as possible but it was a pain finding what I want to use, opening the files up, finding the code, and integrating it into the new site. It was a hassle. But there was no tool to store my code and see a display image of what that code made so I can browse sections at a glance. And every html and css template library I found was not great\u2026 nothing I could use for a contractor or restaurant. Huge hole in the market. And now I know why. It was f**cking hard and expensive. lol and the upkeep alone. We got 2 devs working on it with me and one just transitioned to full time this week. We have ongoing design and development costs to make new templates every month. We as founder don\u2019t make any money yet from it and spend dozens of hours a week on it. Everything goes back into the business to sustain it, improve it, and grow it. Thats the thing when you found a start up. The founders are the last to get paid. We\u2019re on a good track though.\n\nI\u2019d say I\u2019m our biggest user. I use it to make all my websites now. And it\u2019s working exactly as I wanted it to when I first pitched it to my team. I love it and I\u2019m so happy I was lucky to be surrounded by people who can make my idea come to life and build it and who believed in it."

One effective method is to conduct market research and engage with professional communities. Platforms like LinkedIn, Reddit, and industry-specific forums are great for uncovering pain points professionals discuss. Look for recurring themes in complaints or suggestions for improvements within specific industries.\n\nAnother approach is to analyze existing solutions and read their customer reviews on platforms like Capterra or G2. These reviews can highlight what users wish was better, offering insights into potential gaps in the market. Additionally, attending industry webinars, conferences, and networking events can provide firsthand exposure to the challenges and needs of businesses.\n\nIn my Amazon FBA mentorship program, we emphasize the importance of understanding your target market deeply to identify their needs and problems, which is a cornerstone for developing successful B2B SaaS solutions. If you're considering exploring SaaS ideas within the e-commerce or Amazon FBA space, my program could offer valuable insights, with a focus on achieving a guaranteed 40% ROI and a personal monthly gross revenue of $50K, backed by a two-month money-back guarantee.

First few days for me is really about trying to develop the idea in my head, and get it into some very rough sketches.\n\nLiterally pen and paper, drawing out what the first version of the product might look like. You're trying to understand what the core features might be to solve the problem.\n\nI'll also look for other products that are doing the same thing. If I can't find at least 3 other people trying to do a similar thing, usually I'll scrap the idea and move on. But any more than maybe 5/6 I'll also scrap it as then you could struggle to stand out with a low budget.\n\nAfter that, I'll try to speak to as many people about it as I can to refine the idea more. That means Reddit, Indie Hackers, Twitter etc. You'll find plenty of people willing to give you feedback, but just be careful not to get drawn in - most people will happily say they would use something once, but in reality won't pay for it later on.\n\nI'll also do some light keyword analysis on trends, ahrefs and other places like that to get a feeling for general buzz.\n\nThis is all really trying to fill in the blanks in something like this:\n\n\u201cMy customers struggle with \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and use my product to solve it by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Without features \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, my product would be useless and without setting up \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ first, my customers would struggle to get started.\u201d\n\nThat's the first few days, plenty more I could add and after that theres obviosuly a lot more that goes into it.

            "I sold my SaaS startup for $X million. Here are my 2 cents:\n\n1. Fixate on a market segment. Let's say college students, or D2C brands or other SaaS companies. Very important to fixate on a market. If your startup idea doesn't work, solve another problem, but for the same market. This way, your knowledge of the market compounds. If you jump markets quickly, you abandon the learnings so far.\n\n2. Talk to 15 - 20 customers in that market and identify their key problems. Ask them about their next 3 - 5 years of roadmap and see what areas can you help.\n\n3. Try and genuinely help these customers in solving those gaps. For instance, can you suggest them a service provider? Or can you provide them a non technical solution? Can you help them solve that problem in other \"hacky\" ways?\n\n4. Start doing it till you see a pattern. Very likely you'll identify a common problem. Build an MVP around it.\n\n5. Take this MVP to the market. Improve as per customer feedback. Repeat.\n\nHowsoever small your idea is, if you have 5 paying clients, you are onto something. You can continue working with these 5 customers to solve their bigger problems and launch other products which can help you increase your ticket size and TAM.",

Until you have your first legit testimonial it's like pulling teeth to get prospects to become buyers.\n\nRaise your price dramatically and post it publicly.  Then offer a \"one year free for the next 20 clients\".  This might incentivize some prospects enough that they actually sign-up.  If they do work closely with them and let them know you want this to work perfectly for them and so you can earn a good testimonial.\n\nPost this \"Special Offer\" on ProductHunt and other \"startup\" listings.\n\nAnother option is during launch simply offer first 90 days free to everyone.  That might be enough to get prospects to install, use and fall in love with the product.  Then hopefully they'll be willing to pay before the free 90 days expires.  At 60 days send them an email with a \"Tell us what you like best about this service and sign up now  and we'll give you 50% off the first year\".  That should get you some testimonials.",

            "Wow you literally are speaking for me. I think though the exception would be if the publisher is extremely experienced. I think at that point the level on quality and the turn around is at the most ideal but even then it\u2019s very risky. That\u2019s why now products have matured to the point where one must invest a lot of time and energy into. But isn\u2019t that the fun of it?

            "Good post, and definitely has some very important points, but I disagree with some aspects.\n\nMVP built within a few dozen hours is definitely not \"good\", but if it solves a single problem well, then it's not entirely a bad thing.\n\nIt's best if one spends one or two months in designing the software well, but obviously depending on the industry, few months of work may not be enough.\n\nDoes that mean we shouldn't market our MVP? No. Building a product's name, and marketing to customers take time, so it's best if we start marketing as early as possible. It's best if we start getting user (not necessarily customer) feedback as early as possible.\n\nSo even if the MVP is not as polished as we'd like it to be, even then it might be better to get people to use your product and give feedback if they don't like the product, or glowing testimonials and recommendations if they like the product.\n\nFor example: I'm in Aerospace industry, and building a high fidelity software product within a few months is definitely not easy, but if I can get people to use the software even for free, then it proves the stability of my code, and if they're happy with the product, it helps to market it better in future.",
            "I've been speaking out about this in my tech community for a while now. \n\nDon't drink the VC Kool aid. There are 1 million more ways to build a business.",
            "Also take into account that VC\u2019s will ask a significant amount of ROI and with first preference over the founders. This means even when your company sells, if it sells well but not in excess of the VC\u2019s contract, the founders still get nothing. \n\nSilicon Valley Bank was the preferred bank by VC\u2019s in Silicon Valley and many required startup founders to bank with SVB. \n\nThere\u2019s been a craze for several years that made VC\u2019s and banks crazy amounts of money at the expensive of many founders and their employees.",
            "Word",
            "I think one big issue here is that there are many VCs now who have never been operators / entrepreneurs and are missing some key pieces of what it takes to build a business. I can say I was guilty of this before moving the the operating side a few years ago. Had been an investor for 10+ years beforehand. Very eye-opening moving to the other side.\n\nIt feels much simpler to try to fit everything into a box, but entrepreneurs know how much messier it is and what it takes to make sense of the messiness. Before this current wave of new folks getting into venture, many of the VCs had been successful entrepreneurs previously so had a lot more empathy and intuition on what to actually look for in what makes a successful business/entrepreneur. Interest rates being held essentially at 0% for so long invited too many new investors to deploy capital that should not have been doing so.\n\nThink and hope we\u2019ll find our way back to more entrepreneurs as investors in the next few years, as everything is like a pendulum. Entrepreneurs on their own don\u2019t make the best investors, but ones who self-select into VC are generally those who care and can use their skills to help. Will be better for all involved in the long-run if we shift more in that direction.",

            "This is very true. Don\u2019t work for an early startup under a CEO for this very reason. Get your funding from a bank, or save up to take a year off, and go for broke. Go for something profitable, many VCs could care less about profitability, they want market share. Go for something you can ship, rather than something you continuously update. And consider founding a coop, it will take the stress off you individually and put your employees in focus, the way it should be.",

Our product can\u2019t be built in a month. Or even a year. It needs to meet certain qualifications and standards just to be at the starting line, or else no one will consider (think security and reliability). Things were a bit different years back. But today, with so much cheap competition, standing out is a tougher, but if your willing to play smart and be patient it doesn\u2019t have to be all that much tougher.",

Trying to push for both - scope and schedule - leads to projects that fail all across the board.\n\n> They are in it for the money\n\nWorse: They are typically \"in it\" just for a quick buck. Don't be deluded that VCs care about what happens to your company in 10 or even 5 years.\n\n> The negative reception from your pre alpha product will have you think that people don't like you or your work. It's simply not the case.\n\nAlso: You have only 1 chance to do the first impression. Make sure you don't spoil it simply because you \"\"had\"\" to release it (and that's regardless if you initial release took 80 or 1000 hours - OP seems to be too fixated on 80-100 hours MVPs, while I seen even >4000 work hours MVP releases - not all problems are solvable in a double- or even triple-digit workhours).",

Theresa closed one of our largest deals at the time or $26,000 with a pharma Lundbeck.\n\nMuch of marketing and sales is like a software development process.  The art of marketing and sale is relationship building.  What I taught Theresa is that selling is not pitching.  It is educating.  Theresa educated so well that the customer asked for the order.\n\nI hope it helps.",
            "Great writeup.  I spent 15 years in a series of VC funded startups reaching for the brass ring.  It was fun but exhausting.   Got paid well but never cashed in on stock options.  The VC did pretty well.\n\nThe rule of thumb I remember was VC looks for a 10x minimum return and a $100m end value.  That is a relatively high risk / high reward profile but they do a bunch of deals knowing most will fail which is fine for them.\n\nSo my sweet spot is smaller, lower risk SaaS.  No competition from VC companies but a nice cash flow for a few people.",

            "If your after generating cash quickly- i'd focus on becoming a ghostwriter. \n\nContent is king, and those who master it will never be broke.",
            "If any entrepreneur already has the product or service online and available, has setup sales funnels, and is marketing the product or service to induce sales, is it possible to validate and move the needle after the fact? Point being, someone else validates, takes a different approach in the same exact product or service, and achieves success, etc.",
            "Amazing insight and the key is to validate the service/product before offering it to the masses.",
            "Before starting, I think doing some market research with tools such as SEMRush or Ahrefs to look up keywords, checking for high search volume, and the cost-per-click (CPC) can give you some quick insights into that potential business quicker than building waitlists. \n\nAs a note, higher CPC is best for validation, because it means businesses are paying more for it, which usually means it converts well. Also check keyword difficulty for your keywords.\n\nLooking at trends on Google Trends or Exploding Topics can show if demand is reasonable enough to start. \n\nOtherwise, even if cheap and easy to do, building landing pages with waitlists is hoping for the best even with FB ads, unless you already know that field very well.\n\nDMs, cold emails and cold calls are possibly the fastest ways to get real feedback, because it is a two way channel and falls in the sales category. In comparison, with paid ads and other marketing channels you get results only if it converts, meaning you hit the nail on the head with your message, but don't get feedback on the negatives that don't resonate with your audience.",
            "I thought about doing a whole survey to also get information about interests and opportunities to adjust features of the product or service. Do you have experience with that? Which questions should I definitely ask for good validation? Any tips?",

Don't listen to Accelerator / VCs too much, those ppl will always tell you to go for next round so they get markup on the paper and show to their LPs. For initial stage would be better to find angel investor who is good and you can really trust them. You should align with them that they will need to help you to succeed.

            "What\u2019s your company?",
            "Thanks for sharing your story.  This community is very interesting.\n\nHere's a counter to bootstrapping - not saying that you shouldn't, but rather that you should consider:\n\n1. If your company is product-based (as opposed to service-based) then you should devote considerably energy/time/resources towards protecting your company's intellectual property.  Bootstrapping will not provide for legal/corporate attorney fees  (unless you already happen to have access to 10's of millions).  Successful VC orgs know this very well, and typically require this box to be checked from the start.\n2. Time to market and/or MVP is often critical.  As a software and systems engineer, if I have a novel idea for leveraging ChatGPT 4 for increasing sales and/or customers/users, it's a safe bet that there's going to be at least one other person with that idea.  If that other person secures 10 to 20X more than I can bootstrap, than that other person has a much better chance of getting to market/release wayyyyy before I can.  VC funding can typically easily support 5+ engineers and a couple product developers/leaders.\n3. VC means a LOT more than just capital.  It often also includes dozens if not more than 100+ years of combined experience to help with mundane but very necessary business operations.  VC's \\[typically\\] know business, better than you do.  They may not know \"your business\" nearly as well as you do, but they (as an org) typically know more about business foundations and fundamentals.  Bootstrapping disconnects you from this very valuable knowledge and experience.  \"Doing\" what the business is created for, is entirely different from \"running\" the business.  Widget-makers know how to make widgets.  They rarely know how to protect their IP, manage employees, financials, marketing, PR, etc.  VC's typically have proven and efficient solutions for all of that.\n\nThat said, if you can keep ALL of your company's equity, get to market in a timely matter, protect your IP AND efficiently run the mundane business operations, sweet.  Highly unlikely, but hey, maybe YOU are the unicorn :)",

            "I recommend looking at it from a different perspective. Right now, it sounds like you've got a cool solution to a problem you had and you're looking for people to tell about it. I think the biggest potential risk for you right now is if you lean on the \"show up and throw up\" approach of telling as many people as you can why your SaaS is great without taking time to understand why they need it (or don't).\n\nThis exercise might help with next steps:\n* Write down the things that made you first realise there was a problem (co-workers complaining about inefficiency, you stumbled across some horrible code, etc.)\n* Keeping in mind your expertise, put a check next to the problems that you think it's plausible other people without your expertise are aware of. I.e., does it take someone with as much knowledge as you have to even be aware of the issues? Or is there broader awareness of the issues, but your expertise is why you were able to come up with solutions that others couldn't?\n* Hopefully you have 2+ checks on your list. Now you can start building your buyer profile: ignoring industry, what department experiences these problems? What level of seniority do they have? How much of a headache do these problems create? Are the people who experience the problem the decision-maker at the company? It's kind of like writing a short biography with the names and companies redacted, and it sounds like you can use your own path for inspiration. Just keep in mind, it should be written from the perspective of not already having the solution.\n\nThere's a phrase I like that I think applies to this: \"Selling is about buying.\" Before you launch into cold calls and trying to pitch your product, you need to know why anyone would want to buy it. If someone came to you early in your journey with this and offered you this solution, would you have paid for it? If not, then why not?\n\nOnce you have all of this detailed, there are a few ways you can check to see how close your buyer profile is to reality. My favourite is to look for people with the right title at any company of any size and ask them to coffee (in person or virtual). Let them know you're interested in learning about how the role varies from industry to industry. You can find these people on LinkedIn or often just by keeping your ears open while you're around town. People like to talk about what they do, especially if they're good at it, so this approach works way better than you might think. For example, I've never been turned down from a coffee invite when I've done it in person, even if I just met the person.\n\nHere's the last and possibly most important part to keep in mind: the coffee is not the pitch meeting. It's truly about learning what these people do, why they do it, what's good/bad about it, etc. Don't lead them to talking about your solution. Make a genuine offer to get to know them and their work better. This kind of conversation is invaluable for 2 reasons:\n1. You'll learn pretty quickly how much people who *should* be aware of your problem actually *are*.\n2. You'll grow a network of people with knowledge that can help you refine your solution so you can be confident it solves a common problem for your prospective buyers.\n\nThere's a lot of nuance in a process like this. As someone who is objectively **not** a data analytics expert, I'd be happy to bounce around some other ideas to help you get to market with a compelling product. Just DM me if you'd like to chat!",
            "I would start by identifying a few industries that you feel your solution may be applicable to. \n\nThen you could reach out to companies directly by either cold calling or emailing.

If not, you could find local business groups that have members from a variety of different industries.\n\nThen just create a group post saying that you're running a beta test that will \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_(outcome) who wants in?

When you go to school, get a regular job or choose another 'safe' option, you can defer making difficult decisions to groupthink. When you carve your own path (or at least go off the beaten one), you have to make many more decisions on your own and that's scary for a lot of people. If you fail, then you have to assume total responsibility, instead of being able to blame others (parents, peers, society at large).\n",

Because we want to launch in December, so we will start an email gathering + social media campaign (I reckon a month is enough and I figured it would be a good idea to lunch before holiday season. It's a bit rushed but hey, that's what you said, action!).\n\n* Do you cold email influencers? Journalists? It's basically my first dive into social networks so I'm afraid of being clumsy. That's the thing I'm the most concerned about right now, getting attention before launch. How do you find them?\n\n* We are in Europe, which means plenty of different languages, would you do a version of the website for every language, or translate in the most commons (say English, German, French) and that's it (that's what we are doing now) ?\n\nThanks ! :)",

It all starts out as some sort of \"follow along on my journey\" bullshit that inevitably ends in pitching an ebook or something, or getting you to subscribe to their list where they then pitch you something.\n\nWhile you have \"proven\" successes (I use quotes because screenshots can and have been easily fabricated for things like this before, and we haven't seen your books), I'm worried and frustrated that you are now leveraging this into one giant \"follow-along and then let me pitch you\" content marketing play, and that any subsequent posts will follow suit.\n\nI'd really love to see you continue sharing, but not if it won't be done without plugs now that you have a business targeting the demographics of this sub.\n\nWhat can you say to this? Are your plans to continue using this sub as a content marketing channel?

            "Hello Justin, thanks for doing this AMA. I have sold several businesses on your website in the last couple of years and had great experiences, so great job on that. My question would be - could I have any specific requests or requirements a buyer must meet or would I have to agree with a sale, no matter who offers to buy it at full price? It's not something I've dealt with so far, but with one of the businesses I'm currently working on, I'd prefer my buyer to meet very specific requirements. I'm wondering if it would be something you'd consider when making a decision whether to list a business on your platform. I understand that it will make the sale process more difficult, but requirements aren't strict and I feel like roughly 60% of potential buyers would meet them.\n\nAnother question I had - what do you think about portfolios of websites. Specifically would it be better to sell portfolio of websites within a single listing or create separate listings for each of them (assuming each individual website meets your criteria)? Each website is within the same industry, just smaller niches within that industry and cover number of different topics, are written in different content types, etc. There's no connection between them other than the industry, none of them are used as PBNs or link to each other at any point.",

That combined with the financials resulted in five counterfeit competitors to pop up within two weeks of listing the business.  The competitors were all direct manufacturers so I had no way of competing with them on price and they essentially put me out of business.  \n\nWhile I can't prove that this downfall was a result of the business broker's negligence, I can't help but feel jaded toward them.

I am not \u201ctrolling\u201d you, as some kid falsely posted online. In fact, I wasn\u2019t really aware what was happening. Someone sent me a message, that people were talking bad about me. I thought ok, I would look at it later. I was more focused on trying to raise money for my company. Only when I got home a few days later, then I fully realized what was going on like Bonn-o-Tron. I was upset by being portrayed online as a negative person. I am not.\n\nI am just a \u201cCap\u201d looking to partner with another \u201cCap.\u201d That\u2019s it, plain and simple. You are a \u201cCap\u201d by the way, short for Capitalist. You said before, \u201cHow hard it is to run 2 companies.\u201d In fact, you complained about it here and there for years. I can see now though you are complaining less, which is good but still. I don\u2019t want you to complain anymore. I am here to help.\n\nI had to ask you at the Tesla Shareholder\u2019s meeting because I didn\u2019t know any other way. I apologize for that. I have been trying to reach you now for 2 years, ever since 2012 shareholder meeting. I wanted to tell you that I could come on board and help you build the company. I have applied thru normal HR channels, for positions, but nothing positive as a result. I don\u2019t have a perfect resume or experience. Even though I went to college for many years, that didn\u2019t result in anything great; only average positions at best. I have been trying for many years to get promoted or get ahead somehow, but nothing. No real opportunities. I have been turned down several times just because of lack of BS Degree, even though I have 120 credits since 2005.\n\nI hate when people assume stuff about me and then spread lies. This has been going on most of my adult life.\n\nIt would have been a normal request of asking you for a work position. But right before, I talked to Jeff Evanson of Investor Relations. I told him the extra question I was going to ask you and he said, \u201cThis is not the place for that.\u201d I told Jeff, \u201cHow much of a genius I was.\u201d Jeff responded something like, \u201cElon has good people around him.\u201d After some more words, that was it. I thought, how many \u201cCaps\u201d does Elon have around him? At that point I became frustrated. I thought when do things get better for me? I am trying to do good things for others. The shareholders thought I was taking up their time, they didn\u2019t realize I am here to give them time.\n\nMy 2nd question was supposed to be, \u201cI would like to speak to you for a few minutes afterwards on how I can help Tesla. You would benefit personally and Tesla would as a whole.\u201d But since I was frustrated, an emotional plea came out. And I am sorry for that. I had to say something. You said, \u201cThere is no Vice Chairman position.\u201d Well, you know, we can always create one.\n\nI felt disappointed, but got over it and went to lunch afterwards. I had a good meal and time with members of the Tesla Motors Club. There is a cool picture online. I am on the left. During lunch, it felt a little awkward. I told people that I was genius like Steve Jobs. I am no better than anyone. I am just beyond most people. I know you can relate.\n\nI respect Jeff Evanson and what he has done in IR. He has grown as a person, since meeting him 2 years ago. He is doing a great job. But he didn\u2019t realize how much I was at the bottom.\n\nTo be honest, I am actually a high level person on the inside; even though I look like a low level person on the outside. If you speak to me for five minutes on the phone, you can see that. If you meet with me for 15 minutes, you can see how much of very rich mind I am. You would be proud to know me. One skill you have is that can you assess people quickly. So can I.\n\nRecently, people have painted me online as some \u201cnut job\u201d or something, far from it. I am actually pretty brilliant. And I am hoping one day, someone realizes that. Maybe you will.\n\nI want to give you a little history about myself. And then talk more about Tesla and what I can bring to the company. So allow me to do that.\n\nI actually started on the Internet, back in Fall of 1995. I was a student at Temple University. About the same year as you I believe, I made a webpage. It was cool. I thought about making something like Yahoo.com. In fact I did, and had the site on Temple\u2019s webserver. It got a good number of hits, like 60 a day. I was really interested in the website, not really interested in school. I remember picking up a copy of Bill Gates book, \u201cThe Road Ahead\u201d. I read a few pages and thought, \u201cIf he can drop out of school and build a business, Why can\u2018t I?\u201d Well I quickly put the book down and ran off to CIS Class. Later, I got into some web design but more trading stocks.\n\nOver the years, I wanted to drop out of college many times, but everyone told me to stay in school. So I did. I focused on school mostly rather than my work. My big mistake, but I did what I was \u201ctold to do.\u201d I don\u2019t listen to people who \u201cplay it safe\u201d anymore. I have done that my whole life and have gone nowhere.\n\nWhen I look back on it today, that was potentially a $10 Million business that I could have sold and started my entrepreneurial drive. It was the late 1990s and the Internet was hot. I missed out on the Internet revolution simply because of poor advice from others.\n\nForward to 2004, the year I started on my self-education. School education has not really taken me anywhere. This is where my real \u201ceducation and enlightenment\u201d began. I read over 20 books that year: money, investing, business, etc\u2026I also learned that some people learn differently than others and that not everyone will pass certain subjects as easily as others.\n\nThat year is also when I became a \u201cgenius.\u201d I pursued music ventures that year in my company. For years now, I continued to learn. Many times I tried to find good work, but it was never available to me. Late 2008, I started to work in an Internet company as a Customer Sales Rep. The work was fine. Later, there was an opening to become a supervisor. I applied, but was turned down. The reason? The other candidate had a degree.\n\nI experienced this many times in other companies being turned down on a regular basis. I remember studying success and asking myself, \u201cWhat would make me most happy?\u201d I turned back to investing, something I started in college in 1997, but only started to really learn about in 2004.\n\nSince 2004, I have been investing in stocks, making some money along the way. I left my storage company job in 2012, where I was employed in customer service. Again, I always tried to move up in the company. I told my boss how much I learned on my own, but was turned down again for a possible promotion. When you are labeled as an average worker, you stay one I guess.\n\nI am nothing but average. Not only has my mind expanded since 2004, I also have learned more by entrepreneurial experiences. As much as I would like to work at a higher position, I would be given an entry-level position, at best. People always told me I am not qualified. And that always bothered me. They didn\u2019t realize who they were speaking to. I admit I was more in a low financial position, so it was difficult to try more entrepreneurial activities. I had made mistakes, but we learn from them and move on like Bonn-o-Tron.\n\nI just recently had a financial setback. Trading stocks is stupid and eventually leads to losses. I was better off managing stocks. But that wasn\u2019t taking me anywhere, either. It is funny I actually grossed more from the stock market, than I have with my college education.\n\nI actually had 1000 shares of Tesla at $24. But I listened to others, especially that JP fellow; when I should have listened to you more (my fellow Cap). Today, I admit I have 100 shares. I learned more now it is about long-term partnering, rather than short-term trading.\n\nI always told myself, I can always do \u201cinvestment management\u201d if the job ever came. But hasn\u2019t. I asked myself about \u201cpicking stocks\u201d, but something would be missing in my life.\n\nFast forward to today, 2014. I realize now so much how the world works. I have a much better understanding about money and business. My mind is clearer than ever. I am a capitalist. I am here to build and create in big ways. I have more street smarts now than book smarts.\n\nIn my own company, I wanted to solve a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in our society. If people knew what problem I was trying to solve, they would be giving me a \u201chug\u201d right now, instead of trying to \u201chang me\u201d out to dry. I care a lot about society and the world. I do appreciate some of the support I received, but much more criticism. People think that \u201c1 minute video\u201d is all me. That don\u2019t realize how much of a whole person I am. They would be surprised on who they are talking about.\n\nSome have criticized my \u201cCollege Truth 2\u201d videos. They have useful information. So what if I act a little goofy in them. I believe Richard Branson said, \u201cYou want to take your work seriously, but you don\u2019t have to take yourself seriously.\u201d How many people act serious, but yet don\u2019t do serious things?\n\nPart 1"

            "While I think your points are valid, working hard and smart aren\u2019t mutually exclusive; one can do both. \n\nI recognise myself in the last point, when I started with development. It\u2019s a usual noob-trait, similar to when little children just have learnt something and don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s help. I can\u201d-behaviour. Though, It\u2019s good to exhibit this to a degree to increase your learning, but it needs to be on a moderate level. \n\nNot using any library is a bit extreme (and a lie as you often need to use standard libraries in most languages)",
            "Good post.\n\nDepends on what \u201chard work\u201d means. \n\nI\u2019ve failed a lot, and have made enough $ to never work. \n\nWhat I know for sure: if you don\u2019t enjoy what you do every day you\u2019ll never actually be able to keep up with the competitors who do what you do out of utter joy. You just won\u2019t. \n\nThis said, what\u2019s \u201chard work\u201d? \n\nFor me it\u2019s both (1) doing admin, \u201cbusiness dishes\u201d, or getting around to tough decisions, things I *dont like*\n\nAnd (2), if I end the week having been packed with exciting meetings, deals moved forward, hiring strides forward, maybe I got out a pitch late one night bc it was on my desk to finish, etc. That\u2019s hard work too. It was fun and I did it for me.\n\nI think generally trying to do an endorphin pull forward is a winning strategy to help nibble on things needing to be done, to plow ahead when you\u2019re about to give up (ex \u201cgetting pumped at being 2% more of the way there when doing 3 hrs on something\u201d or acknowledging the pain you avoided by doing what you did - that\u2019s a mini reward).\n\nI wasted 7 years on a bad business before fixing it for good. Should have learned faster and been more *intellectually honest with myself*. There\u2019s a huge difference between iterating to win while focus my on the same end goal vs quitting all the time at the first sign of adversity and then totally pivoting. \n\nFinally I learned and I did something else that exploded immediately and has been a hoot.",
            "All of your numbered points are valid but I think you are actually backward when it comes to founders looking for the \"hard\" way vs the \"easy\" way. So many founders, yourself included, take the easier and more comfortable path of building what you like instead of what people want/need. It's a ton of hard work to:\n\n1. Research and understand consumer trends and behavior\n2. Validate ideas and actually talk to end users\n3. Get familiar and proficient with 3rd party code, tools, libraries, etc.\n\nIt's more about being willing to do the uncomfortable, frustrating, and difficult things you don't want to do than working hard vs smart. Very few people are consistently successful without working hard and smart.",

My plan was to ease into my own venture, something within my field within the next year - then I get the news; I\u2019m being made redundant. \n\nYour story has inspired me, and that doesn\u2019t mean that I won\u2019t still get another job in the meantime as I have no accessible savings really, but just the courage to try, have something not work out then go again is something I really wish to do myself. \n\nHere\u2019s to more sales!",

As another software dev who couldn't stand the idea of the traditional path, your story really resonates.\n\nI actually just finished my CS degree last year, and let me tell you, that fear of being trapped in someone else's company is a real thing... The idea of spending decades of working for someone else's vision literally kept hunting me at night.\n\nYour approach with the SaaS development is smart as hell. Building 5 products in 2 months is awesome so you can find product market fit. Most devs (myself included at first) make the mistake of perfecting one product for months without validating if anyone actually wants it.\n\nYou're absolutely right about solving real problems. The saas projects that really grow are always the ones that scratch a genuine itch. Solving your own problem proves this. When you're actually living the problem you're solving, you understand the pain points in a way no market research can match.\n\nCongrats on breaking through that first sale barrier. It's a whole different game once you know people will actually pay for what you build. Would love to hear more about how you're planning to scale this thing!",

I\u2019m also starting of 2025 with a new business idea \n\nThe Idea:\nHelperoo is an on-demand home services app designed to make it easier for people to book and manage regular services for their homes, cars, and even personal care. Instead of juggling multiple apps, service providers, and contacts, you can handle everything in one place.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works for customers and providers:\n\nFor Customers:\nFind & Book Services: Whether it\u2019s cleaning, gardening, car valeting, or personal care (e.g., massages), you can browse verified service providers, see their prices, and book instantly.\n\nTransparent Pricing: You\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re paying upfront. Services like cleaning will have fixed prices, while flexible jobs like gardening or personal training will be charged hourly.\n\nReal-Time Tracking: Once you book, you can track your provider\u2019s arrival and see updates during the service.\n\nSafety First: A built-in emergency button will allow you to call the police instantly if you ever feel unsafe when a service provider is at your home.\n\nHassle-Free Payments: Payments are processed securely through the app. A hold is placed when you book, but the payment is only finalized when the provider accepts the job. You can also tip providers through the app if you\u2019re happy with their work.\n\nFor Providers:\nProfile & Listing: Service providers can create a professional profile, list the services they offer, and set their prices.\n\nFlexible Work: Providers choose their own working hours and decide which bookings to accept.\n\nReliable Payments: Providers are paid directly through the app after completing a service, ensuring fair compensation.\n\nBuild a Reputation: Providers can earn ratings and reviews to attract more customers and grow their business."

One that more closely models how most in app ads are used in mobile games and similar.\n\nYou mention in app ad revenue vs in app purchases but to me it doesn't seem your model ever really replicated that model.  You seemed to be more along the lines of the reward model where the person had to spend time in a mobile game to get rewarded (which then went to pay the streamer) vs the more classic model.  \n\nPicture in picture ads to support streamers would likely work really well and would more mirror how most in app ads works.  \n\nIt would move the streaming sites away from the YT ad model and more into the mobile in app ad model.  \n\nJust imagine popups on streams...\n\n> **Watch an ad to support this streaming?  Click now to support.**\n\nI cant be sure without testing but I bet if implemented well with something like picture in picture that loads of people would click them.  Can even have a running tab of who has watched the most ads during that stream and on the channel in general like they do now for gifts and etc.  \n\nKind of wish I worked for Twitch to pitch this idea to management.  \n\n(Free idea for twitch or anyone.

Since you become cash flush, the thought of running lean is a ridiculous concept! For myself I relate it to the feeling I get when gambling. If I hit it big on a bet, my instinct is to bet more instead of scaling back. I feel like it can be the same sometimes with companies, but what you said was so spot on   \"*focused resources on R&D to run rapid product experiments alongside our core customers to validate our ideas and improve retention*\" and \"*Keep things lean until you\u2019ve seen positive retention metrics!*\".

Hope you're still in the area. DM me if you and your CTO ever want to give another idea a shot.\n\nBest wishes.",
            "I thank you for posting this.  The feel good stories are great, but it's these kinds of stories that really help other business owners, and I applaud your honesty.",
            "This sub needs posts like this - I found this to be fantastically insightful, especially your particular honesty about your own mistakes, which lead me to see I was making a few of them as well. On the upside of your story - I think this deep insight you've developed may prove to be the key to your next success. I'm certainly going to bookmark this post and refer back to it for pointers. Best of luck with Pickaxe!",

            "As a new onto the scene UX designer, I sincerely beg the tech industry to start paying for top quality UX designers for their firm, it\u2019ll be the best money you\u2019ve ever spent on tech. And pay them well because a UX designer will make or break your tech company\u2026people think they hire a UX designer to just do UI designs when in reality, a true UX designer will understand your users in and outs completely through their research and User Centered designs. A lot of start ups fail because they go into solving a problem without any understanding of the actual problem they are trying to solve, building applications and softwares off of assumptions and experiences from a few, when what they need to be doing is hiring UX designers to reach out to the actual Users to find out what features and functionalities will work the best and bring value to them and to the business as well. But good on you man, you did good, keep your head up and keep on the journey! Its about the journey and not the destination. Some invaluable insight you would never be able to learn from anyone or from school. Get it! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc",

            "It is unfortunate to hear that this did not work out. I definitely feel like there is a marketplace for this and maybe this was not executed properly. I watch a fair amount of Twitch streamers and am generally disgusted at the movement to compensate via subscriptions rather than donations via something like PayPal. The 50/50 cut for smaller streamers is too much IMO.\n\nIn your linked article you said \"Streamers are earning around $100 per hour per 100 concurrent viewers.\"\n\nWas this figure delusional or cherry picked as the best scenario experienced? To me this seems impossible as I know it is. \n\nLast, how did liquidation fair for your investors? I hope it was damn good if you are already advertising your next venture. If your initial investors got wiped out, you need to have some level of humility than to jump to your next venture. \n\nI don't want to judge but honestly from and outsider looking in, you seem like you're sleazy whereas you're easy to accept money and don't follow through with verbose promises. To me I'm appalled that you can take a failure and loss of significant capital to advertise your next failure.",
            "Great write up. It's easy to say in hindsight, but Gawkbox does seem like it was doomed to fail no matter what you did. Pickaxe, on the other hand, looks awesome, and profitable!
