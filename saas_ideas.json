The problem you have is that the asset you have is: \"Relationships with executives, directors and decision makers of said industry.\" and you need to convert this asset into sales. Product development happens with the customer. You need the customer first. So you need to think about what is the minimum thing you can sell to said executives, directors, and decision makers today, or well at best literally next month. \n\nMaybe the burden of switching to your platform is too high and you need to create a plugin for their existing platform. Maybe your app vs is a Trello plugin. Maybe you need to sell it as IP-backed consulting. I don't know. But unless you know what you're selling don't bother writing a line of code.",

            "Have you done \"back of the envelope\" financial projections?  Figured out how much money you can reasonably expect to make - and compared that with the cost ($5K? $20K? $100K?) or developing your service?   Let's say you can get everything working for $50K.  Is the income going to surpass that? \n\nIf you are CERTAIN  - then:\n\n\\- Draw pictures of the APP, make a presentation, and go show it to a couple of potential customers.  Tell them you are NOT trying to sell this to them. Just wanting their input on your idea - and then ask them what it might be worth to them (monthly, yearly, whatever).  \n\n\\- Adjust your economic projections based on their answers.  Maybe you over/underestimated the value of your idea.   (And you said it is a \"local\" idea... which I assume limits it's value.  If you can re-purpose to other \"local\" areas, obviously that greatly increase the value of your service. \n\n\\- If it's still worthwhile based on above, then write up a \"technical\" document that explains exactly what the service is (page 1)... and how the software/service would work.  I.e, show every screen your users would see, and explain to the computer programer(s) exactly what each screen and each button would do.  Draw pictures and notate them with arrows to each button, etc. \n\nYour software development costs increase with complexity.  E.g.,  if you have different levels of users (Admin, super user, basic user) that is more complex than a \"stand along\" system with only one type of user.  \n\n\\- Take your tech doc and find some developers to talk to.  Their pricing will be all over the place.  Make sure they have working examples of their work that demonstrate they know how to do what you need.  (E.g. Do you need 3 types of users? Have they done something with different types of users?)   If you go to them and say \"I need this (pointing to tech doc) can you do this?)\"  - you can figure out which can or can't do the project - then ask them to give you a price and a timeline.

RESEARCH: Do some market research to confirm what features your buyers need, what pricing model would work, and what they might pay.  You could do this by taking a few people you trust out for lunches/coffee, and maybe even asking a few others you don't know as well. Also look online to see what competition you have, and what features/pricing they have.\n\n2. PLAN: Draft out a rough business/marketing plan - to make sure it'll make money, and that there's a good outline of how the product/service will work and generate revenue for you.  In this process, you can also decide how/who to fill the roles required of the business, if it's a go. \n\n3. EXECUTE: If AND ONLY IF the plan makes sense, and you're prepared to put in some effort, then you can proceed to 1) developing a brand for your product, and getting a web domain/site for it.  2) getting the money together (some of your old customers/connections might invest, or you can hit the banks, etc) and 2) contracting the programmers and building the product out.\n\n  \nMake sense?

Hire on Upwork - it's fairly simple to learn, but I doubt learning it would be the best use of your time right now.  \n\\- Talk to your connections, have them DEMO the product, ask for their honest feedback (what was confusing, what they liked, what they wish it did), ask how much time & money they saved/what they'd pay. Do *not* try to sell customers right now - feedback is infinitely more valuable at this stage than the few bucks you could get by selling customers on a half-baked product (that they'd probably leave after a few months anyway).  \n\\- Iterate product, onboarding, etc. w/ the feedback, launch a website, run some paid traffic to the website to test offer.  \n\\- Play around with different offers, audiences, etc. - see what connects.  \n\\- Onboard first few (paying) customers, use proof of concept to recruit a technical co-founder that can help you fully flesh out the product from MVP to scalable software.\n\nBest of luck, rooting for you.",
            "Let's connect! I've worked for a couple years in the construction industry and am a startup co-founder. I can help you get started! \n\nThe way forward would be to build an MVP (either a hi-fidelity figma mockup, or an actual MVP) and then show it to potential customers. Take feedback, iterate, and repeat. That's the only way to build out a SaaS. Given you relationships with decision makers, and industry-specific expertise, you can get a lot done on the none-technical side and the initial product design side.",

But at the same time if someone is ready to pay and get onboard you have a validated idea and a customer willing to pay. \n\nThings get far more clear once you an essense of budget because then you can clearly weigh between hiring someone to build or learning yourself etc.",

Find a cheap local coffee supplier and come up with a cool label and people will buy it. It\u2019s similar to wine now. \n\nIf not manufactured yourself, you can find contract manufacturers for pretty much anything. Most of the cost/value of the product is from the brand, label, IP anyway. Start a fad or following and you\u2019re in the money.\n\nFor example, celebrities (Trump, Kardashians) always put their brand names on cheaply produced products to increase value like cosmetics, alcohol, clothing, whatever. It\u2019s a goldmine for them. These are the wealthiest most successful people of our time and they just figured out how to themselves to a brand. \n\nBut other things, in the public domain, can also be brands, like politics, state and city names, popular sayings, the list is endless.",

Here are some grabs from my finds that might inspire you:\n\n**1. Virtual Wrench**  \nGot a car issue? Who needs to get greasy when a virtual mechanic can diagnose issues in their PJs?\n\n**Why now?:** The gig economy is thriving, and with platforms like JustAnswer booming, this innovative idea taps into a very lucrative and growing $500 billion gig economy market.\n\n**2. Real Estate Crowdfunding Platform**  \nTurning every couch potato into a landlord without the hassle! Crowdfunding as an option for those who want to brag about their real estate prowess without actually doing anything.\n\n**Why now?:** Given the inflationary environment and increasing interest in real estate as a hedge, collective investing platforms are gaining attention. The global real estate crowdfunding market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 58% by 2028.\n\n**3. EcoInsurance**  \nInsurance that actually wants to save the planet, rather than just ignoring it.\n\n**Why now?:** With biodiversity and climate crises looming, companies are starting to realize that eco-friendly is not just cool, it's necessary. Particularly with $20 billion annually needed to combat biodiversity loss globally.\n\n**4. Deepfake Defence Force**  \nProtect the world from cyber-fakes with a SaaS solution detecting AI-driven deepfakes. It's like having your personal Sherlock Holmes, but for the digital age.\n\n**Why now?:** Internet scams leveraging deepfake technology are on the rise, taking advantage of increasingly sophisticated AI tools to deceive people on a massive scale.\n\n**5. AI Powered Restaurant Management System**  \nWhy rely on humans when AI can handle restaurant operations? Revolutionize dining experiences with a digital butler.\n\n**Why now?:** Post-pandemic, restaurants are embracing tech like never before. The global market for restaurant management software is set to grow by 14.3% annually.\n\n**6. Single Parent Match**\n\nThis dating app is specially designed for single parents juggling kids, work, and finding love. Because you shouldn\u2019t have to choose between finding a soulmate and finding a babysitter!\n\n**Why Now?**: The single parent population is growing rapidly, with over 11 million single parent families in the US alone. Traditional dating apps often overlook the unique needs and challenges faced by single parents.\n\n**7. Digital Safe space for Teens**  \nCreate a digital platform offering safe, moderated chat rooms and forums where teens can discuss mental health, academic pressures, and everyday challenges anonymously. Picture a space where teens can vent, share memes, and get support without worrying about trolls or oversharing.\n\n**Why Now?**: The mental health of young people has been significantly impacted by the pandemic, with rising rates of anxiety, low mood, and self-harm. A digital safe space can provide crucial support outside of school hours .\n\n**News Trigger**: Antidepressant use in child mental health services increased by 44% in the last decade",

Additionally, B2B selling is even more challenging. You can create a great product, but unless people trust that you know what you\u2019re talking about, selling it will be very difficult.

At 21 you'd better believe I was stoked. It was the first glimpse I had of it actually being possible to earn a living doing something I love. \n\nI continued to run a small web hosting service and take on one-off coding requests form clients. Almost all of which went on my resume. As someone who didn't finish college, I needed all of the experience I could get. A couple of years later, a small company reached out to me, through monster.com (god I'm old, lol). I've been with the same company for almost two decades now, and I couldn't imagine doing anything else. \n\nAll because of some project that I cooked up over a summer.

            "In my limited time bootstrapping my own stuff, I raise a glass to your list.\n\nMy version:\n\n* **B2B > B2C** (except if you've some specialized unserved niche that you can have an app up and running in a few days and are willing to just gamble).\n* **No VC** - I haven't done VC, but hear horror stories. One interview I heard yesterday said, if you make a $2M business as a bootstrapped company you're a success. But in VC you need to get to $100M. However, how many businesses can get to a $100M valuation. You're setting yourself up for failure.\n* **Nail outreach** - distribution will make or break you. Outreach + no product = pre sell product. Product + no outreach = no sales.\n* **Yes to SEO & Content; No to relying on it 100%** - Google is seriously monkeying with search results. So you need SEO and content, but make sure you have other avenues as well.\n* **Piggyback off other traffic sources** - Reddit, Pintrest, Quora, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, etc. Know them. Love them.\n* **The Time Investment to Validation Ratio** - the longer it will take to build something, the longer you should take to validate it. If you can get it up in a weekend or a week, then you can risk less validation.\n* **Off the shelf as much as possible** - At the beginning you have no idea if your project will work. So it's easier to start with a $199 boilerplate than spend 3 months reinventing the wheel. Use as many off the shelf and free tools as you can. Google Forms are your friend. You can even create signable documents in JotForm for free.\n* **Tiny MVP:** I know so many successful projects that started out as a Excel or Google sheet. Start with the minimum minimum viable product. Try to not code at all until you have paying customers.\n* **The \"Jay Leno\" approach** - If at all possible have a day job. When your project gets traction, then jump to it. Jay Leno said he's never lived off his tonight show money. He lives off the earnings from his stand up gigs. I've seen a lot of successful projects that were helped by this model.\n* **Either people buy your product/service or they don't** - You'll get so many \"that's a great idea\" or \"I'd be open to using your service in 6 months when you launch\" or \"I love this, let me talk to my boss\" or \"this could be a great partnership for us where we can send you a lot of business let's spend the next 6 months working out a deal\" or \"how about we use your service for an equity deal in our company that hasn't made any money yet\". Farts in the wind. Cash in hand is the ultimate validation.\n* **Research, Research:** Look up how much competition you'll have on Google. Find a successful business model to copy and ask what are their traffic sources and how long have they been successful. Understand your market.\n* **The Long Haul:** Something may be a great idea, that serves a market, that's validated, that's easy to build, but ... do you want to work on this idea and promote it for the next 3-5 years? Launching is one thing. Continuing to put effort into it is a whole other challenge.\n* **Sunk Cost Quicksand:** It's very hard to kill a project after you've put years into it. I've been working on a site for 2 years with zero monetary returns. Currently I'm transitioning it to a more passive model and will let it just exist. But it's very hard not to want to put more effort into it when I know it could have potential. One developer says if you haven't made any money with it in 3 to 6 months, you should probably kill it. However, I know a project that's currently making $70K MRR but it took them 3 years to get to $1K MRR. So it's a tricky balance to know if you're being persistent or being a fool.\n* **Get to Money Sooner:** Big funded companies can afford to exist in the red for years (or a decade), but most of us have limited money, time, and effort. The faster you can get a project, website, business to cash, they sooner you'll know you have traction.\n* **Some other lessons:** [https://twitter.com/adamdenverco/highlights](https://twitter.com/adamdenverco/highlights)",

            "Good post OP. I just have a nit pick.\n\n> Today I have 1 fullstack dev doing 5x more progress on a project than a team of 12 back then. Avoid \"teams\" at all costs.\n\n30+ year Senior Dev here (who's also started and worked for startups). I retired earlier this year, but they just pulled me back in. Probably the most well known project I worked on was Apple's iCloud for instance. I wrote the load balancer they used to scale the huge Exabyte storage needs they had.\n\nYou probably have a really good fullstack dev. Or your apps are pretty simple. But at the end of the day it's impossible to have expertise in everything. Tech is just too complex for that. A person who keeps up with all the Front end madness that is happening (React, Svelte, TypeScript, node...) cannot possibly also be at the cutting edge about infrastructure the way a DevOps Engineer can. A guy writing front end will not be able to maintain a complex Kubernetes Operator in Go at the same time.\n\nThere is just too much context switching. And vice-versa, a DevOps guy isn't going to be great at front end design. Sure they can do it, but it will take 3 times longer and it won't look quite right.\n\nI'm sorry but that's just not a thing. In development pretty much every area is constantly evolving, and you have to keep up with it. No single person can really keep up with everything. \n\nIt just sounds like your businesses needed more front end guys, and you were hiring the wrong people for the job. Likely outsourcing difficult scaling back-end issues to other IaaS/SaaS providers.\n\nThough I do agree, 1 bad ass can outwork a team of 5 for sure. Hope you're paying your guy well.",

            "Literally LOL'd at #15, because I've been that corporate drone being rewarded as a perk.\n\nOn #16. I don't think it is fair to say Scrum itself is a scam.  I agree with your premise though....because most of the people selling their expertise in it are scamming companies. Real Scrum was supposed to be a set of tools on top of what you described -- hiring grown ups to do the work and let them manage themselves. But everybody just cargo-cults the terminology and continues the old school top-down management approach under the covers.\n\nMy biggest regret is putting off quitting my 9-5 and getting started for so long. Now that we're going, my fears about failure and lost income opportunity from quitting my 9-5 don't seem so bad. Instead of the blocker they were before, they kind of became a motivator because I do need income, and now my business is the path I'm on to get it.",
            "Wow, this is point for point what should be sent to the founder of the startup I was a part of that just collapsed lmao",
            "That is a great list! I haven't agreed this hard with a list in years.\n\nI would add the following, from my experience:\n\n1. **Never add to your feature list in front of outsiders.** I've been in so many meetings with investors or customers where someone daydreams a crazy new feature and the founders say something along the lines of: \"Oh, that's brilliant! We'll do that for sure!\" At that point, I'd say the venture has a 10% chance of survival. Never commit to an idea you haven't fully explored, not just in terms of the effort required, but the cost of distracting you from your original goals. The second you say \"yes\" to an idea in front of an outsider, that idea is *all* they will ever ask about, and a failure to deliver it will outweigh anything else you do.\n2. **Pivot with purpose.** If, during validation, several people tell you you're missing the mark, then you probably need to pivot. I've seen founders dig in their heels and refuse to adapt, often using a variation of: \"We'll prove them wrong.\" You probably won't. But at the same time, don't pivot too easily (or often), because being a weather vane means you'll end up pleasing no one, and never be able to reach any of your (likely numerous, disparate) milestones.\n3. **Hammer salesmen will always see nails.** Hiring outsiders and consultants is generally risky, but if you do, do not fall for their tunnel vision. The second you bring in a consultant, they are going to try to upsell you. Need help with a devops problem? They'll spot a thousand inefficiencies that also need fixing. Need help with a marketing issue? They'll find a thousand things you are doing wrong that are stunting your growth. It's not that they're *wrong*, but they aren't there to see you succeed, they're there to maximize their earnings. They will be very convincing and hard to resist, but you need to have clear specs at the outset: fix this problem, and that's it. \n4. **Always. Communicate. Internally.** Full disclosure between the core team is absolutely essential. Report back important details the second they happen. Text the group on the way back from the meeting. Voice worries after a rough night of no sleep. Flag slippage that you can feel but not quantify yet. The team only works as a team if everyone has all the information, good or bad. Siloing information leads to inefficiencies at best, and Game of Thrones-type paranoia and plotting at worst. It's amazing how many startups implode because someone was afraid to share some bad news, one time, and it spiralled out of control.\n5. **Don't buy toys.** If you get funding of any kind, do not buy yourself the latest *whatevers* unless you really truly need them. An impressive workspace will charm investors to an extent, but at some point they will start to suspect you're spending all your time window shopping and not working, and the core trust in your competency starts to erode in unfixable ways. Buy toys with revenue, not other people's money.",
            "Your biggest mistake was launching 30 startups in 20 years.  Amazon didn't make a profit for 10 years.  Tesla needed 17.  I joined a company as employee #10.  7 years later it sold for $100 million.  It also took years to make a profit and it took a leadership team entirely focused on building a great product rather than building something they could flip.",
            "John, I might add: \n\n* **Thinking you need a lot of money to start a venture**\n* **Not seeking a co-founder:** mainly for the emotional load of creating a company\n* **Underestimating the importance of cybersecurity:** Many founders struggle with cyberattacks. \n* **Pivoting too late:** The business landscape can change rapidly. Startups need to be able to pivot and adjust their strategies as needed.\n* **Focusing solely on growth hacking:** While user acquisition is important, neglecting long-term customer retention and satisfaction can be detrimental.\n* **Not focusing in marketing:** while having a great product is important, distribution must be considered.",

I suggest you seek to understand it, its aim is literally what you cite as its weakness.\n\nThere are too many scammers and pretend experts out there out there who lead to people having your view but scrum is NOT a scam.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a startup and high functioning, there\u2019s a 90% chance you are agile.\n\nI\u2019d love to understand why you think that though. I\u2019ve used it to make drastic, positive change and I\u2019m constantly fighting the attitude that thinks what is being asked is to standup every day and sit through pointless meetings.",
            "As a specialized developer I'll chime in about points 10,16 and 19.\n\n10. I agree with this at the start. Specialists are there to optimize their specialty. They are great if you have a team and each member or pairs of members are responsible for a different part. But when you first start out a generalist will most likely be able to get an MVP out faster. The downside can be that it won't scale as well, but that's a problem for after you've gotten some customers. And that's the problem specialists should come in for; after you already have an MVP and some momentum so now you need them to polish or add new features to your product. \n\n16. Scrum is meant for large organizations that have a lot of bureaucracy. It doesn't usually make sense in a small company. The whole point of scrum is to make sure everyone is communicating and to address any blockers someone is having. It's meant for quick iterations on a product in an otherwise slow environment. If you only have 3 developers that work together every day, there's 0 point in trying to formalize a scrum process or hire a scrum master. The only way this might work for a smaller team/company is if different people are working on different parts in a vacuum. Then, yeah sure, every day or every other day have a quick 15 minute \"check-in\" to give each other updates. But again, if your teams are already communicating well, this is irrelevant.  Scrum is to software development what Six Sigma is to manufacturing; they're both meant to increase effectiveness of your resources by implementing feedback mechanisms and processes. But if you already have good processes, all they'll do is clog up your existing system. \n\n19. For MVPs, yeah, use whatever pre-built stuff you can get that'll work. There's no reason to re-invent the wheel and coding from scratch can be a lot of unnecessary work for some things.",

            "I wish I had read this list before my startup. I committed a lot of the same mistakes as you as well. The tech conferences is a good one - you\u2019d think you go there to meet a lot of investors and other startup founders you can align with, which is both rarely the case",
            "Number 7 - skipping idea validation. Was my biggest - build and they will come strategy is massively flawed.  At the beginning this is where most of founder energy needs to be placed.",
            "Great post OP. \nME with 13 startups in the past 35 years. Several paid big, most get shuttered within 2 years. Held many titles doing many different jobs before engaging in startups, that helped. I smiled at #4, #5 & #6, having dodged those. Even doing hardware projects I agree wholly on #1 however.. having sold a line of consumer products in giant volumes netted that startup a huge valuation and payoff. Marketing to consumers is fickle. Big risk big reward. #8 is gold, they have no place in a startup, nor exec positions that aren\u2019t actual Doers, no time nor funds for overhead, even if your account says ok. #9 is also gold as I\u2019ve wasted SO much time and energy on wasted BC meetings where they barely paid attention and offered so little while demanding so much. Likewise the current fuss over Scrum is largely blather, hire solid people and manage deadlines. \n\nAnd finally, my apologies for your losses on #20, for as an entrepreneur I took off time for Every Little League practice, soccer practice, ballet recitals, track meets and ANYTHING that my kids were doing came first , then back to the office after dinner and bedtime stories. \n\nSome startups failed but I got to be there for my kids. Priceless.",
            "not having discipline and organization and understanding of business and not like being serious about it, and especially not having deadlines well more so tracking progress. I am back on track and focused now.  I actually like that you said scrum is a scam. it makes sense, because you just need to get to point A to point B, you dont need to scrum, when you can just go to point A to point B simply, much like driving, you dont need a GPS but its useful, but knowing your roads and how to \"find your way\" is most important. so i wasted time trying scrum and so on as well. last realization i notice is prioritizing the wrong things.",
            "I like this list a lot except for #16.  Scrum is a philosophy and methodology that has had enormous impact on software development.  What method do you suggest then? Waterfall? Cleanroom? Spiral? Prototyping?  Your criticism makes me wonder if you are not actually critical of Scrum but of poorly implemented Scrum.",
            "Good point about scrum. If ppl aren\u2019t proactive and working on creating value then they shouldn\u2019t be there.",
            "Scrum is definitely a scam.  I do quibble with taking VC money though.  The better thing is to take any kind of investor money, VC or otherwise, to scale or grow rather than develop.  \n\nAI for instance has been an R&D problem for the last 50 years and no one has wanted to fund it except Darpa and Google. But now that it's a scale and tuning problem VCs can't seem to throw enough money at it."

            "I\u2019d highly recommend setting up a landing page as soon as possible\u2014before the app is even fully launched. Given the growing demand, capturing early interest is crucial to building a strong user base from the start. A well-optimized landing page, combined with an email marketing strategy, can help you generate and nurture leads, ensuring that potential customers stay engaged until your product is ready.\n\nFrom my experience working with a high-growth business (outside of the medical field), I\u2019ve seen firsthand how missed lead opportunities can become a major setback. You don\u2019t want to wait until launch to start building an audience. Even if capital is a challenge, marketing now will help you test and refine your positioning, attract potential customers, and increase your chances of securing investment later. Moreover, building a waitlist of engaged users can be a strong validation point when approaching investors.\n\nWould love to hear more about your specific go-to-market strategy\u2014are you planning on direct sales (B2B outreach) or inbound marketing to drive adoption?",
            "Start small and local. Face-to-face with medical businesses will give you real feedback and help perfect the product before scaling. Plus, those early adopters become great case studies.\n\nBubble is fine for validating your idea and getting initial traction. When you hit performance issues, that's actually a good problem - means you've found market fit.\n\nLanding page is secondary. Focus on getting 10 paying customers first. Their feedback will be worth more than any marketing spend right now."

I've subscribed to one myself and it's a pretty decent one and here are my 2 cents based on a paid subscription to a business ideas subscription.\n\nYou need 3 tests for an idea to really bootstrap an idea successfully:\n\n1. I**s there demand for this solution? is this addressing a burning pain?** in this case it's not. I agree with the fact that there is room for custom forms and that's why there are too many solutions. But the big question is are they profitable? There are some people looking for custom solutions but are they big enough a market for building a custom product? Are they all looking for the same solution or they are asking for very high customization?\n\n**2. Can I build and sell this solution?** building it would be easy, but selling it would be tough. First of all, OP admits it's a crowded market. And some of the players are funded. If you are competing with funded players for marketing space, we all know the outcome (look at Uber Vs Taxi industry, Airbnb vs individual hotel owners)\n\n**3. Am I interested in creating this?** well, in case you are trying to build something from an idea subscription, you have to wait in a never ending queue to see something you are really passionate about. That's my opinion from the subscription.\n\nI've never seen anyone in my life who failed in a business and admitted that they failed because their idea sucked (including myself). The reason is when people come up with an idea themselves, they would find a ton of different excuses except for the fact that the idea sucked. People have that conviction about an idea because it's original. But will they be able to build something and have equal conviction in case of borrow-and-build approach?",

It's a really tough market to break into. Currently we're trying to niche towards developers by providing APIs for data retrieval. We also explicitly avoid 'form builders' because a developer has to style everything on their side anyways and that just gets in the way. I'll go through and outline our response to the 'chops' you laid out.\n\n**Unique niche**\n\nDevelopers. Insanely easy setup that connects you to the rest of your workflow. APIs.\n\n**Tech Chops**\n\nOur tech stack is just javascript all the way down. We use express, nuxt, vue, and... that's pretty much it. We deploy all our stuff on AWS and each of our actions (taken per submission) is its own lambda behind a simple queue. Our costs are fairly high, but it's very cheap to scale once we need to, plus [we got a bunch of AWS credits](https://formcake.com/blog/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits) which should keep us going through the rest of next year.\n\n**Marketing Chops**\n\nWe focused on the long tail blogging strategy and haven't focused on driving traffic except through that yet. Partly because we wanted to spend most of this year making sure our tech was solid without the pressure of too many annoyed users. Now that we feel really solid there we're starting to push on more active marketing efforts. This probably wasn't the best idea and we should have been pushing harder on it from the start but... marketing is hard!\n\n**Cost Analysis**\n\nWe're running WAY over the cost you quoted. We could have built it on a cheaper stack but since we wanted to build for scale we over-engineered a bit. This isn't the fastest path to market but I hope it will pay off for us in the long run.",

A good example that I have come across is My AI Front Desk where you can just rebrand their AI-powered customer service solution and start offering it to businesses right away, without having to worry about any coding or technical setup. A lot of white-label SaaS providers give you some flexibility when it comes to ownership and control. If you ever want to switch things up or customize the software more, they can give you options for that. It\u2019s a perfect solution if you want to get started quickly and focus on marketing and sales while using a product that's already up and running."

Many of your competitors have 5 stars with 50+ reviews.  What's the main reason for the lower reviews with your companies?  \n\nPlease don't take this as any knock on you or your businesses. I just think that most of us see you as the gold standard for service businesses and if this is an area you are struggling with it would be really difficult for those of us looking to start.

            "Getting a few reports on this so I thought I would recognize the issues raised and make sure everyone knows what is going on.\n\n**Reports about self-promotion and spam:** u/localcasestudy owns launch27.com and Groovehiring which he points out.  These sites provide services for service booking businesses. When you read his posts please keep in mind he does have cause to favor it - but he also points that out himself (\"...if we do say so ourselves..\"). People doing AMAs are allowed to provide a modest number of links to their company if it is material to their AMA which certainly seems to be the case here. Given that guideline, given that there are no affiliate links in the OP and given the relative amount of information to links I don't think the post would qualify as spam, particularly given ongoing involvement in Q&A. One other concern might be if the video content were all self-promotional. I will be reviewing the videos shortly but given the titles/descriptions I don't expect them to be simply cloaked sales pitches for real information.\n\n**One report was for threatening and harassing.** There doesn't seem to be anything like that in the OP. If you were serious about this report please contact the mods. If a comment was harassing please report that specific comment so we can investigate. \"Harassing\" means attacks on you as a person it does not mean saying something you disagree with or attacking your concepts, thoughts or position on issues. Criticism is fair game. Name-calling or worse is not. We take these type of reports very seriously but reporting something as threatening to try to raise alarm level when it is not is just as serious. Only use this type of report if you are being harassed or threatened.\n\n\n---\nEdit: So this post explaining why I did what I did has now been reported as \"Mod team are shills\" and \"Fucking stupid.\" Everyone is free to respond to this post and point out why I am wrong. I listen to that and consider it. If you make a solid case I will change my position on things. It is important to me to be logical and rational and that means recognizing I can be wrong. \n\n---\nEdit: I'm asking the other mods to take a look and review the post to find out if I was in error making this a sticky as an AMA and to make sure I am not being biased in evaluating the reports. I would much prefer a discussion of why people see this as an ad rather than an AMA (yes, I do understand the formatting suggests ad and the phrasing feels marketing but when I drill down to look at how much is actually promotion I see promotion of a concept rather than a service. Haven't reviewed the videos yet though.) Please tell me how I am wrong. I will be reviewing the back and forth both in this post and others.\n\n---\nEdit: So a fair number of the reports seem to be saying it is improper to have this stickied. One asked how much I was paid to sticky it (nothing incidentally, I thought it would qualify to be stickied under our past AMA guidelines). Since that was just my call and since I've asked the broader mod team to review it I will be unstickying it until they do so and decide how to go. **Was it a mistake for me to sticky it? I think so but not for the reasons you might think.** I think it was acceptable to do so under our policies for AMAs but I don't think that it helped the community. The post was already visible to everyone because of the supporting upvotes it had received. Stickying it just pissed off people who didn't want to see it. I didn't see that coming and apologize for missing it and doing the wrong thing. Trying to help and failed. Sorry",

If an anonymous entrepreneur came in and gave the same recommendations, they'd be just as valid as this guy's. He tells you he owns it - he tells you he recommends it - because he believes in it. This isn't snake oil and hair tonic; you have every opportunity to do your own research and validate. Are you offended that he recommended Stripe.com instead of PayPal or Square?

            "Hey everyone, since this is a thread about starting new business I thought I may ask here instead of starting new thread. I hope that's okay.\nAbout two weeks ago I've finally decided to start my own company. I am a backend web developer with 5 years of experience. I do feel confident enough to start my own company, when it comes to skills. Speaking of business side of this idea, I've been reading a lot for the last couple of years. Also my wife has been tremendously helpful, always pointing out things I've missed or had wrong idea about. I've written my business plan, and I know who do I want to target. Taking advantage of the fact, that the city where I live is full of tech startups - I want to reach out to those entrepreneurs and offer them help with backend of their services/ mobile and web applications/ automation/ API's and server side. I am experienced with recent technologies, frameworks and trends in this area, so I'm sure I can provide a satisfactory service to my potential customers. The only thing I am not quite sure of as for now is how to reach these companies. I live in Hong Kong, and websites as YELP, Craiglist and others are not really popular here. Also, I can imagine that advertising B2B is very different from B2C advertisement. I've found this website, listing most recent and trending startups in here, and I was thinking about sending them emails with an offer? I am surely going to attend numerous entrepreneur meetups and conferences. I have a website and business cards. I have so many questions and I do not expect you guys to answer all of them, but I hope I can get some advice and/or tips on how to get into that field as a one-man suit company? I am not excluding possibility of collaborating with one of my front-end web designers friends, to be able to offer a wider variety of services, however I mostly want to focus on a back end side, as that is my specialty, and something I feel most familiar with...\n\nThank you a lot!\n",

Or do you always go with teams of 2?\n3 - biggest operation challenge for me (after managing staff) is travel. My city is massive, easily 30 miles across and we have some heavy snowfall sometimes.

We hired two mechanics full-time who have been with us for 6 months. Things were going smoothly with both steady increase in demand & operationally very good feedback on the service we provided.\n\nThen recently we started seeing demand for waterless car wash. So we added this as part of our service and saw demand really shooting skywards. The mechanics were temporarily taking care of the cleaning until we hired full time cleaners.\nThen suddenly both our mechanics vanished along with the entire toolkit & supplies. Customers got pissed off, we weren't able to find cleaners quickly enough and had to pause all services for a few weeks.\n\nWe are going back online with a new hiring strategy. Outsourcing our cleaning staff to an agency. Outsourced staff will be trained by us and use our supplies. If any of the staff leaves, the agency immediately assigns a new person. Since it is a low skill job and the kind of supplies used make us unique, hoping this strategy works in the long run.\n\nOn the mechanic side, we have improved our candidate selection process and offering better incentives for a minimum duration of employment.\n\nThe biggest lesson we have learnt through all of this is always prepare for churn.",

            "Validation means different things to different people.  But generally speaking show the product to as many people as possible and then get feedback.  Sometimes you can also do general research to know if in fact that there is a demand in an industry.  Sometimes its much more difficult to tell and you have to do alot more customer feedback and validation sessions.",
            "Hi,\n\nMaking sure your B2B SaaS idea is good before you start building it is really important. It can help you save time and money. You wonder if you\u2019re being too careful by not talking to people until you have something to show, but I personally think getting feedback early can actually be super helpful. \n\nIf you talk to a few people you trust, they can give you good advice without you feeling like you\u2019re using up your contacts. Just let them know you\u2019re looking for feedback, not trying to sell them anything.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about reaching out to people you don\u2019t know to get their thoughts, that can work too. You can make a quick survey or talk to people to see if your idea makes sense to them. \n\nYou can also try some other ways to check or see if your idea is good. \n\nFor example, you can make a simple web page that explains your idea and see if people sign up for updates. This can show you if people are interested. If you have time, making a basic version of your tool can help you get feedback. There are tools that let you make a simple version of your software without needing to actually code it.\n\nRemember, this advice is coming from someone who\u2019s really good at launching Private Label (PL) products on Amazon. So if you want more information about PL, just let me know!\n\nThanks",
            "You're not being too cautious. Your network is valuable, and you're right to save it for when you have something concrete to show. Don't burn those connections on early-stage validation.\n\nCold outreach can work for idea validation, but it's not great. Here's a better approach:\n\n   - Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find people matching your ICP. Send InMails (not DMs).\n   - Export that list to a tool like Apollo or RevenueBase to get their email addresses.\n   - Clean the list with Reoon to remove bad emails.\n   - Use an email outreach tool like Smartlead to send personalized cold emails.\n   - Keep your daily send volume under 30 per email address for good deliverability.\n   - Offer something valuable in exchange for their time (industry insights, gift card, etc.)\n\nYou don't need hundreds of responses. Even 20-30 good conversations can provide solid validation. Once you have a demo, then leverage your network for real deals.\n\nSource: I run a B2B email outreach agency (OutreachBloom)"

At the moment I'm a product manager, using a combination of AI, automation, and low code/headless cms tools to scale processes or to make them more efficient. I love the application of the tech in complete solutions more than just living on the bleeding edge of AI technology.\n\nMy background is systems engineering, which is just the idea of treating your entire business or domain as a system of systems that are interconnected. AI isn't a tool that solves all problems, but can be deployed in components of the business. Being able to conceptually understand a business's needs combined with understanding what AI tools are out there I think is a nice intersection.\n\nI was considering that it might be possible to focus on local businesses as well in areas that aren't particularly tied into the latest emerging technology.",

For AI to realize its potential, the technology would need to get democratized. Curious if anyone here has thoughts on the utility of being able to automate document workflows (take data in from one or more sources, process it however relevant with AI and place at precisely controlled target locations on deliverables). Would a no-code tool that could do something like that help these small businesses and proprietors?",

I have been looking for the past week to give this AAA model a try, however I am slightly worried of selling a product to a costumer that could compromise the privacy of the data gathered. For instance, I wanted to create a telegrambot for real state agents within my city to help them schedule visits. However, since ppl would have to give their phone number for that, I fear that using Botpress and Zapier could mean that their data gets leaked if there is a breach one day. Also, I fear services such as the ones mentioned, to close and having to interrupt my services because of that. Could you shed some light on how do you deal with that?\n\nOn another note, is it possible to program a Bot like this ones from scratch, running on our own servers so that the data doens't get to the public, but I guess that the data would be leaked eitherway anytime the OpenAI API is called, right?",

You can even do it for free by using personal email addresses until the project takes off.\n- anything technical (user auth, db, whatever) using the native solution from the cloud vendor is my go to. I.e I wouldn\u2019t want any technical decisions made for me. You can get pretty far even with the free tier, especially if you choose serverless technologies\n\nI like where your head is at.

I joined your course a month ago on Udemy and I found that your teachings are awesome.\n\nI am also interested in web technology and now I'm learning PHP and MySQL to get solid foundation of programming. I like WordPress a lot and I hope to be a WP developer.",
            "Really like your approach here, with both of your apps! \n\nIt's great to see you sorting through which feedback to take on board e.g you iterated quickly on your script because you got a lot of requests for it - but you haven't been swayed to reduce your price because (and I agree) it's a fair price for those that need your podcast management. \n\nIt can be tough to know who/what to believe but you seem to know your own mind and have a great deal of focus. Also sharing your methods has resulted in you validating the need for another paid product which is a bonus! :)\n\nRegarding your price - I think $29 pcm is fine - if you do a weekly podcast and podigniter saves you an hour+ of time then that's well worth $7.50 - it can even add revenue to your bottom line when it remembers to bill sponsors on time! \n\nAs a pair of fresh eyes I have a few initial points of feedback - \n\n* **Branding Emphasis Needed**  The name (or a logo) needs to be more prominent to be memorable - if people try to re-visit at a later date as you add features they will have a hard time remembering your name & are unlikely to currently find you through search. \n* **Clarify Your Headline** - The phrase 'on top of' feels a little vague. 'Organize' or 'Automate Repetitive Tasks' are more powerful - your target market will identify with feeling unorganised or having to regularly do tasks manually\n* **Your Audience Is Split** - You have 2 very distinct markets, new & established podcasters. Brand new podcasters don't yet know the pain of podcast administrivia & may not instantly see the value. They don't yet have sponsors so signing up to any paid product pulls them further away from profitability. This crowd will tell you your product is 'expensive' when it's not. Established podcasters with high paying sponsors would probably pay 10x your price but may be too set in their ways to move over to a new service. They may demand more features as they attempt to completely replicate what they do themselves. If you're aiming for 'easy to use' avoid adding everything they ask for. Be mindful of which audience you are writing your copy for. \n* **Social Proof** - Getting some known podcasts using this service would a huge credibility indicator if you could put their logo on your site. Their mentions would be great advertising at $0/little cost.\n\nI know it's early days & you may have all of these ideas & possibilities in mind anyway - write them all down & any one you find yourself writing down multiple times are obviously have recurring needs. \n\nLooking forward to hearing how it progresses for you over the coming months!

Two of the products that I created (1st one made $150k lifetime and second one made $350k lifetime) I was a participant and I solved a personal problem and provided it as a service. \n\nI also started an e-commerce business which did close to $1m in gmv by purely being early. 18 months down the line the market was saturated and I couldn't turn a profit, I had to shut it down.",
            "Thanks for the insight. It was an interesting read.\n\nI actually agree with you when you talk about finding a product that solves the problem, if there is a market for it then it's probably one of those businesses that could explode. My question would be related to supply, you spoke about how your friend wanted those hoodie blankets so there must have already been people who sell those products otherwise they wouldn't have thought about buying it. So my questions are:\n\n1. How saturated was the market when you started your business?\n2. What was the key differentiator between your product and the competitors that made the business work?\n3. How did you source the product?\n\nIf you don't mind sharing your answers for those, it would be a great learning point for me as an aspiring entrepreneur.",

Restaurants, landscaping, heck even vacuum\u2019s. \n\nCompetition is GOOD. It means the idea works, and you can make a metric ton of money by thinking of not something new to do, but how to do something better. \n\nYou\u2019ll also save a ton of time as you won\u2019t be spending it on your own half-baked ideas.",

            "Decent general advice, curious what your net take home is? Monetizing online, especially social media endeavors, are extremely high risk, you are beholden to the corporate whims of the platforms and more and more the political whims of our society.  \n\nSo you had a good year thus far based on your gross revenue but call it what it is, you are dropshipping, a middleman store front.  What's your plan to sustain this? \n\nThe Comfys or whatever you bought and sold for a markup were a fad, can you keep guessing the trends? \n\nright now you are nothing more than a middle man marking up the \"hit\"  merchandise, what value do you actually produce? You are not inventing the products, producing them, improving upon them, owning real estate to allow people to provide goods and services. \n\nAgain some good wisdom in your post but your model is unlikely to last for a career, having an online front and being a middle man dropshipping is already overdone and saturated.  Markup on average is about 10% to a high of 20% so if you have really low expenses and a markup on the higher end, your net revenue is ballpark, 75k to 140k not including costs, website, marketing, POS, cc fees etc.... \n\nBe surprised if after all is said and done you pierced 100k take home. I love a good discourse tho, prove me wrong.",

            "Ah, the perfect startup recipe: no code, no money, no business plan, no customers. You're essentially a stealth mode startup so stealthy, even you don't know what you're doing next. Congratulations, you've achieved ninja level in entrepreneurial mystery!",
            "The entrepreneurial bug has bitten you. Welcome to the SaaS dream. A couple of problems you may run into early that I want to warn you about:\n\nYour product development overhead may be low but you'll have to deal with customer support, bug fixes, deployment issues, server cost if your product does well, marketing etc.\n\nWhen you hire a developer or a team of developers, you need to retain them for the long term. You're product is going to go through many different iterations before you find product market fit and the speed at which you need to iterate in order to capture the market needs to be there. This will cost you more than having a technical cofounder.\n\nFinding a developer is easy. Finding a good developer is hard. Finding a good developer who cares enough about the product to move fast enough...\n\nSaas isn't going anywhere. With the help of no code tools and AI, you can build an MVP and validate your idea. And you can learn how to code and build out your project at the same time.\n\nGood luck to you",
            "Yep, come up with some ideas, test them all out by seeing if anyone is interested. Get a list of users that are interested and find a way to connect with people to pitch to them. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to know how to code, honestly that will delay you more.",
            "I come from a software background. And I'll give some counter intuitive ideas here I have learnt the hard way. \n\n1. With saas and software it is very easy for someone to copy you and build what you have so unless you really have a technical advantage, most saas businesses are not successful. \n\n2. You need to catch a wave + do something naughty. Most of the big startups you know like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Snapchat, YouTube all did morally questionable things early on to corner the market (which later got revised out of history) and they started when the internet was just getting popular. \n\n3. Saas has become more popular in the YouTube business education space because no code tools have become better + chat gpt etc. However, this also means that competition has increased massively. And as an insider I can tell you that the saas wind deep in the tech world is already slowing down. People are tired of subscriptions. \n\n4. Selling saas is hard. Explaining what your software does is  not easy and it can be hard to translate the value of your software into your clients minds. Especially if they are non tech. \n\n5. Finally you have to stare at a screen everyday for a long long time. Many people underestimate this. Yes you can hire etc but you would still have to spend quite a bit of time staring into a terminal especially if your software is successful. \n\nIf you are in an area like silicon Valley with good university pedigree, joining an accelerator like YC and doing a saas is worth it. Or if you know investors and can get funding then go ahead. The playbooks are written and quite clear. Such as b2b saas for example. \n\nBut if you really like business and are interested in building the future, sell things people need. Shoes, houses, clothes, fitness, health. People will always need these things. And you don't have to sell them. They know what these things are. So you just have to tell them what's special about yours. \n\nHaving said all this if your heart tells you that programming is what you're passionate about, disregard everything I said and get going.",

It allows you to provide valuable software solutions to customers without the need for them to manage installations and updates, which enhances user experience and retention. Additionally, the market for SaaS is continually growing as businesses seek more efficient and cost-effective tools to manage their operations. However, it also requires substantial initial investment in development and ongoing costs for maintaining and improving the service. Success in the SaaS space often hinges on addressing a specific niche or problem effectively and offering excellent customer support."

            "Copying what I said in another sub you asked this is \n\nI created an html and css component library called CodeStitch. I came up with it a couple years ago when I was talking to my dev and designer buddies after finishing a large project. My dev friend asked if anyone had any leads or ideas on the next thing to work on and I said \u201cit would be nice if I had a little library I could browse by website sections and see the displays of website sections I made and click a button to copy and paste them into my project so I can reuse my code snippets much easier and build my websites faster\u201d and he said \u201cdude I would use this today. How much do you need?\u201d\n\n3 years ago probably $100k later we are doing pretty well with almost 4K users and 1k member discord server for freelancers and users to share their creations and get advice. We got a nice little community going go also had the same need but there wasn\u2019t anything on the market to do it for them.\n\nTheres a new tailwind component library every week. But there\u2019s not a single good HTML and CSS competent library out there with good designs and clean code. I kept trying to reuse my own code as much as possible but it was a pain finding what I want to use, opening the files up, finding the code, and integrating it into the new site. It was a hassle. But there was no tool to store my code and see a display image of what that code made so I can browse sections at a glance. And every html and css template library I found was not great\u2026 nothing I could use for a contractor or restaurant. Huge hole in the market. And now I know why. It was f**cking hard and expensive. lol and the upkeep alone. We got 2 devs working on it with me and one just transitioned to full time this week. We have ongoing design and development costs to make new templates every month. We as founder don\u2019t make any money yet from it and spend dozens of hours a week on it. Everything goes back into the business to sustain it, improve it, and grow it. Thats the thing when you found a start up. The founders are the last to get paid. We\u2019re on a good track though.\n\nI\u2019d say I\u2019m our biggest user. I use it to make all my websites now. And it\u2019s working exactly as I wanted it to when I first pitched it to my team. I love it and I\u2019m so happy I was lucky to be surrounded by people who can make my idea come to life and build it and who believed in it."

One effective method is to conduct market research and engage with professional communities. Platforms like LinkedIn, Reddit, and industry-specific forums are great for uncovering pain points professionals discuss. Look for recurring themes in complaints or suggestions for improvements within specific industries.\n\nAnother approach is to analyze existing solutions and read their customer reviews on platforms like Capterra or G2. These reviews can highlight what users wish was better, offering insights into potential gaps in the market. Additionally, attending industry webinars, conferences, and networking events can provide firsthand exposure to the challenges and needs of businesses.\n\nIn my Amazon FBA mentorship program, we emphasize the importance of understanding your target market deeply to identify their needs and problems, which is a cornerstone for developing successful B2B SaaS solutions. If you're considering exploring SaaS ideas within the e-commerce or Amazon FBA space, my program could offer valuable insights, with a focus on achieving a guaranteed 40% ROI and a personal monthly gross revenue of $50K, backed by a two-month money-back guarantee.

First few days for me is really about trying to develop the idea in my head, and get it into some very rough sketches.\n\nLiterally pen and paper, drawing out what the first version of the product might look like. You're trying to understand what the core features might be to solve the problem.\n\nI'll also look for other products that are doing the same thing. If I can't find at least 3 other people trying to do a similar thing, usually I'll scrap the idea and move on. But any more than maybe 5/6 I'll also scrap it as then you could struggle to stand out with a low budget.\n\nAfter that, I'll try to speak to as many people about it as I can to refine the idea more. That means Reddit, Indie Hackers, Twitter etc. You'll find plenty of people willing to give you feedback, but just be careful not to get drawn in - most people will happily say they would use something once, but in reality won't pay for it later on.\n\nI'll also do some light keyword analysis on trends, ahrefs and other places like that to get a feeling for general buzz.\n\nThis is all really trying to fill in the blanks in something like this:\n\n\u201cMy customers struggle with \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and use my product to solve it by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Without features \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, my product would be useless and without setting up \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ first, my customers would struggle to get started.\u201d\n\nThat's the first few days, plenty more I could add and after that theres obviosuly a lot more that goes into it.

            "I sold my SaaS startup for $X million. Here are my 2 cents:\n\n1. Fixate on a market segment. Let's say college students, or D2C brands or other SaaS companies. Very important to fixate on a market. If your startup idea doesn't work, solve another problem, but for the same market. This way, your knowledge of the market compounds. If you jump markets quickly, you abandon the learnings so far.\n\n2. Talk to 15 - 20 customers in that market and identify their key problems. Ask them about their next 3 - 5 years of roadmap and see what areas can you help.\n\n3. Try and genuinely help these customers in solving those gaps. For instance, can you suggest them a service provider? Or can you provide them a non technical solution? Can you help them solve that problem in other \"hacky\" ways?\n\n4. Start doing it till you see a pattern. Very likely you'll identify a common problem. Build an MVP around it.\n\n5. Take this MVP to the market. Improve as per customer feedback. Repeat.\n\nHowsoever small your idea is, if you have 5 paying clients, you are onto something. You can continue working with these 5 customers to solve their bigger problems and launch other products which can help you increase your ticket size and TAM.",

Until you have your first legit testimonial it's like pulling teeth to get prospects to become buyers.\n\nRaise your price dramatically and post it publicly.  Then offer a \"one year free for the next 20 clients\".  This might incentivize some prospects enough that they actually sign-up.  If they do work closely with them and let them know you want this to work perfectly for them and so you can earn a good testimonial.\n\nPost this \"Special Offer\" on ProductHunt and other \"startup\" listings.\n\nAnother option is during launch simply offer first 90 days free to everyone.  That might be enough to get prospects to install, use and fall in love with the product.  Then hopefully they'll be willing to pay before the free 90 days expires.  At 60 days send them an email with a \"Tell us what you like best about this service and sign up now  and we'll give you 50% off the first year\".  That should get you some testimonials.",

            "Wow you literally are speaking for me. I think though the exception would be if the publisher is extremely experienced. I think at that point the level on quality and the turn around is at the most ideal but even then it\u2019s very risky. That\u2019s why now products have matured to the point where one must invest a lot of time and energy into. But isn\u2019t that the fun of it?

            "Good post, and definitely has some very important points, but I disagree with some aspects.\n\nMVP built within a few dozen hours is definitely not \"good\", but if it solves a single problem well, then it's not entirely a bad thing.\n\nIt's best if one spends one or two months in designing the software well, but obviously depending on the industry, few months of work may not be enough.\n\nDoes that mean we shouldn't market our MVP? No. Building a product's name, and marketing to customers take time, so it's best if we start marketing as early as possible. It's best if we start getting user (not necessarily customer) feedback as early as possible.\n\nSo even if the MVP is not as polished as we'd like it to be, even then it might be better to get people to use your product and give feedback if they don't like the product, or glowing testimonials and recommendations if they like the product.\n\nFor example: I'm in Aerospace industry, and building a high fidelity software product within a few months is definitely not easy, but if I can get people to use the software even for free, then it proves the stability of my code, and if they're happy with the product, it helps to market it better in future.",
            "I've been speaking out about this in my tech community for a while now. \n\nDon't drink the VC Kool aid. There are 1 million more ways to build a business.",
            "Also take into account that VC\u2019s will ask a significant amount of ROI and with first preference over the founders. This means even when your company sells, if it sells well but not in excess of the VC\u2019s contract, the founders still get nothing. \n\nSilicon Valley Bank was the preferred bank by VC\u2019s in Silicon Valley and many required startup founders to bank with SVB. \n\nThere\u2019s been a craze for several years that made VC\u2019s and banks crazy amounts of money at the expensive of many founders and their employees.",
            "Word",
            "I think one big issue here is that there are many VCs now who have never been operators / entrepreneurs and are missing some key pieces of what it takes to build a business. I can say I was guilty of this before moving the the operating side a few years ago. Had been an investor for 10+ years beforehand. Very eye-opening moving to the other side.\n\nIt feels much simpler to try to fit everything into a box, but entrepreneurs know how much messier it is and what it takes to make sense of the messiness. Before this current wave of new folks getting into venture, many of the VCs had been successful entrepreneurs previously so had a lot more empathy and intuition on what to actually look for in what makes a successful business/entrepreneur. Interest rates being held essentially at 0% for so long invited too many new investors to deploy capital that should not have been doing so.\n\nThink and hope we\u2019ll find our way back to more entrepreneurs as investors in the next few years, as everything is like a pendulum. Entrepreneurs on their own don\u2019t make the best investors, but ones who self-select into VC are generally those who care and can use their skills to help. Will be better for all involved in the long-run if we shift more in that direction.",

            "This is very true. Don\u2019t work for an early startup under a CEO for this very reason. Get your funding from a bank, or save up to take a year off, and go for broke. Go for something profitable, many VCs could care less about profitability, they want market share. Go for something you can ship, rather than something you continuously update. And consider founding a coop, it will take the stress off you individually and put your employees in focus, the way it should be.",

Our product can\u2019t be built in a month. Or even a year. It needs to meet certain qualifications and standards just to be at the starting line, or else no one will consider (think security and reliability). Things were a bit different years back. But today, with so much cheap competition, standing out is a tougher, but if your willing to play smart and be patient it doesn\u2019t have to be all that much tougher.",

Trying to push for both - scope and schedule - leads to projects that fail all across the board.\n\n> They are in it for the money\n\nWorse: They are typically \"in it\" just for a quick buck. Don't be deluded that VCs care about what happens to your company in 10 or even 5 years.\n\n> The negative reception from your pre alpha product will have you think that people don't like you or your work. It's simply not the case.\n\nAlso: You have only 1 chance to do the first impression. Make sure you don't spoil it simply because you \"\"had\"\" to release it (and that's regardless if you initial release took 80 or 1000 hours - OP seems to be too fixated on 80-100 hours MVPs, while I seen even >4000 work hours MVP releases - not all problems are solvable in a double- or even triple-digit workhours).",

Theresa closed one of our largest deals at the time or $26,000 with a pharma Lundbeck.\n\nMuch of marketing and sales is like a software development process.  The art of marketing and sale is relationship building.  What I taught Theresa is that selling is not pitching.  It is educating.  Theresa educated so well that the customer asked for the order.\n\nI hope it helps.",
            "Great writeup.  I spent 15 years in a series of VC funded startups reaching for the brass ring.  It was fun but exhausting.   Got paid well but never cashed in on stock options.  The VC did pretty well.\n\nThe rule of thumb I remember was VC looks for a 10x minimum return and a $100m end value.  That is a relatively high risk / high reward profile but they do a bunch of deals knowing most will fail which is fine for them.\n\nSo my sweet spot is smaller, lower risk SaaS.  No competition from VC companies but a nice cash flow for a few people.",

            "If your after generating cash quickly- i'd focus on becoming a ghostwriter. \n\nContent is king, and those who master it will never be broke.",
            "If any entrepreneur already has the product or service online and available, has setup sales funnels, and is marketing the product or service to induce sales, is it possible to validate and move the needle after the fact? Point being, someone else validates, takes a different approach in the same exact product or service, and achieves success, etc.",
            "Amazing insight and the key is to validate the service/product before offering it to the masses.",
            "Before starting, I think doing some market research with tools such as SEMRush or Ahrefs to look up keywords, checking for high search volume, and the cost-per-click (CPC) can give you some quick insights into that potential business quicker than building waitlists. \n\nAs a note, higher CPC is best for validation, because it means businesses are paying more for it, which usually means it converts well. Also check keyword difficulty for your keywords.\n\nLooking at trends on Google Trends or Exploding Topics can show if demand is reasonable enough to start. \n\nOtherwise, even if cheap and easy to do, building landing pages with waitlists is hoping for the best even with FB ads, unless you already know that field very well.\n\nDMs, cold emails and cold calls are possibly the fastest ways to get real feedback, because it is a two way channel and falls in the sales category. In comparison, with paid ads and other marketing channels you get results only if it converts, meaning you hit the nail on the head with your message, but don't get feedback on the negatives that don't resonate with your audience.",
            "I thought about doing a whole survey to also get information about interests and opportunities to adjust features of the product or service. Do you have experience with that? Which questions should I definitely ask for good validation? Any tips?",

Don't listen to Accelerator / VCs too much, those ppl will always tell you to go for next round so they get markup on the paper and show to their LPs. For initial stage would be better to find angel investor who is good and you can really trust them. You should align with them that they will need to help you to succeed.

            "What\u2019s your company?",
            "Thanks for sharing your story.  This community is very interesting.\n\nHere's a counter to bootstrapping - not saying that you shouldn't, but rather that you should consider:\n\n1. If your company is product-based (as opposed to service-based) then you should devote considerably energy/time/resources towards protecting your company's intellectual property.  Bootstrapping will not provide for legal/corporate attorney fees  (unless you already happen to have access to 10's of millions).  Successful VC orgs know this very well, and typically require this box to be checked from the start.\n2. Time to market and/or MVP is often critical.  As a software and systems engineer, if I have a novel idea for leveraging ChatGPT 4 for increasing sales and/or customers/users, it's a safe bet that there's going to be at least one other person with that idea.  If that other person secures 10 to 20X more than I can bootstrap, than that other person has a much better chance of getting to market/release wayyyyy before I can.  VC funding can typically easily support 5+ engineers and a couple product developers/leaders.\n3. VC means a LOT more than just capital.  It often also includes dozens if not more than 100+ years of combined experience to help with mundane but very necessary business operations.  VC's \\[typically\\] know business, better than you do.  They may not know \"your business\" nearly as well as you do, but they (as an org) typically know more about business foundations and fundamentals.  Bootstrapping disconnects you from this very valuable knowledge and experience.  \"Doing\" what the business is created for, is entirely different from \"running\" the business.  Widget-makers know how to make widgets.  They rarely know how to protect their IP, manage employees, financials, marketing, PR, etc.  VC's typically have proven and efficient solutions for all of that.\n\nThat said, if you can keep ALL of your company's equity, get to market in a timely matter, protect your IP AND efficiently run the mundane business operations, sweet.  Highly unlikely, but hey, maybe YOU are the unicorn :)",

            "I recommend looking at it from a different perspective. Right now, it sounds like you've got a cool solution to a problem you had and you're looking for people to tell about it. I think the biggest potential risk for you right now is if you lean on the \"show up and throw up\" approach of telling as many people as you can why your SaaS is great without taking time to understand why they need it (or don't).\n\nThis exercise might help with next steps:\n* Write down the things that made you first realise there was a problem (co-workers complaining about inefficiency, you stumbled across some horrible code, etc.)\n* Keeping in mind your expertise, put a check next to the problems that you think it's plausible other people without your expertise are aware of. I.e., does it take someone with as much knowledge as you have to even be aware of the issues? Or is there broader awareness of the issues, but your expertise is why you were able to come up with solutions that others couldn't?\n* Hopefully you have 2+ checks on your list. Now you can start building your buyer profile: ignoring industry, what department experiences these problems? What level of seniority do they have? How much of a headache do these problems create? Are the people who experience the problem the decision-maker at the company? It's kind of like writing a short biography with the names and companies redacted, and it sounds like you can use your own path for inspiration. Just keep in mind, it should be written from the perspective of not already having the solution.\n\nThere's a phrase I like that I think applies to this: \"Selling is about buying.\" Before you launch into cold calls and trying to pitch your product, you need to know why anyone would want to buy it. If someone came to you early in your journey with this and offered you this solution, would you have paid for it? If not, then why not?\n\nOnce you have all of this detailed, there are a few ways you can check to see how close your buyer profile is to reality. My favourite is to look for people with the right title at any company of any size and ask them to coffee (in person or virtual). Let them know you're interested in learning about how the role varies from industry to industry. You can find these people on LinkedIn or often just by keeping your ears open while you're around town. People like to talk about what they do, especially if they're good at it, so this approach works way better than you might think. For example, I've never been turned down from a coffee invite when I've done it in person, even if I just met the person.\n\nHere's the last and possibly most important part to keep in mind: the coffee is not the pitch meeting. It's truly about learning what these people do, why they do it, what's good/bad about it, etc. Don't lead them to talking about your solution. Make a genuine offer to get to know them and their work better. This kind of conversation is invaluable for 2 reasons:\n1. You'll learn pretty quickly how much people who *should* be aware of your problem actually *are*.\n2. You'll grow a network of people with knowledge that can help you refine your solution so you can be confident it solves a common problem for your prospective buyers.\n\nThere's a lot of nuance in a process like this. As someone who is objectively **not** a data analytics expert, I'd be happy to bounce around some other ideas to help you get to market with a compelling product. Just DM me if you'd like to chat!",
            "I would start by identifying a few industries that you feel your solution may be applicable to. \n\nThen you could reach out to companies directly by either cold calling or emailing.

If not, you could find local business groups that have members from a variety of different industries.\n\nThen just create a group post saying that you're running a beta test that will \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_(outcome) who wants in?

When you go to school, get a regular job or choose another 'safe' option, you can defer making difficult decisions to groupthink. When you carve your own path (or at least go off the beaten one), you have to make many more decisions on your own and that's scary for a lot of people. If you fail, then you have to assume total responsibility, instead of being able to blame others (parents, peers, society at large).\n",

Because we want to launch in December, so we will start an email gathering + social media campaign (I reckon a month is enough and I figured it would be a good idea to lunch before holiday season. It's a bit rushed but hey, that's what you said, action!).\n\n* Do you cold email influencers? Journalists? It's basically my first dive into social networks so I'm afraid of being clumsy. That's the thing I'm the most concerned about right now, getting attention before launch. How do you find them?\n\n* We are in Europe, which means plenty of different languages, would you do a version of the website for every language, or translate in the most commons (say English, German, French) and that's it (that's what we are doing now) ?\n\nThanks ! :)",

It all starts out as some sort of \"follow along on my journey\" bullshit that inevitably ends in pitching an ebook or something, or getting you to subscribe to their list where they then pitch you something.\n\nWhile you have \"proven\" successes (I use quotes because screenshots can and have been easily fabricated for things like this before, and we haven't seen your books), I'm worried and frustrated that you are now leveraging this into one giant \"follow-along and then let me pitch you\" content marketing play, and that any subsequent posts will follow suit.\n\nI'd really love to see you continue sharing, but not if it won't be done without plugs now that you have a business targeting the demographics of this sub.\n\nWhat can you say to this? Are your plans to continue using this sub as a content marketing channel?

            "Hello Justin, thanks for doing this AMA. I have sold several businesses on your website in the last couple of years and had great experiences, so great job on that. My question would be - could I have any specific requests or requirements a buyer must meet or would I have to agree with a sale, no matter who offers to buy it at full price? It's not something I've dealt with so far, but with one of the businesses I'm currently working on, I'd prefer my buyer to meet very specific requirements. I'm wondering if it would be something you'd consider when making a decision whether to list a business on your platform. I understand that it will make the sale process more difficult, but requirements aren't strict and I feel like roughly 60% of potential buyers would meet them.\n\nAnother question I had - what do you think about portfolios of websites. Specifically would it be better to sell portfolio of websites within a single listing or create separate listings for each of them (assuming each individual website meets your criteria)? Each website is within the same industry, just smaller niches within that industry and cover number of different topics, are written in different content types, etc. There's no connection between them other than the industry, none of them are used as PBNs or link to each other at any point.",

That combined with the financials resulted in five counterfeit competitors to pop up within two weeks of listing the business.  The competitors were all direct manufacturers so I had no way of competing with them on price and they essentially put me out of business.  \n\nWhile I can't prove that this downfall was a result of the business broker's negligence, I can't help but feel jaded toward them.

I am not \u201ctrolling\u201d you, as some kid falsely posted online. In fact, I wasn\u2019t really aware what was happening. Someone sent me a message, that people were talking bad about me. I thought ok, I would look at it later. I was more focused on trying to raise money for my company. Only when I got home a few days later, then I fully realized what was going on like Bonn-o-Tron. I was upset by being portrayed online as a negative person. I am not.\n\nI am just a \u201cCap\u201d looking to partner with another \u201cCap.\u201d That\u2019s it, plain and simple. You are a \u201cCap\u201d by the way, short for Capitalist. You said before, \u201cHow hard it is to run 2 companies.\u201d In fact, you complained about it here and there for years. I can see now though you are complaining less, which is good but still. I don\u2019t want you to complain anymore. I am here to help.\n\nI had to ask you at the Tesla Shareholder\u2019s meeting because I didn\u2019t know any other way. I apologize for that. I have been trying to reach you now for 2 years, ever since 2012 shareholder meeting. I wanted to tell you that I could come on board and help you build the company. I have applied thru normal HR channels, for positions, but nothing positive as a result. I don\u2019t have a perfect resume or experience. Even though I went to college for many years, that didn\u2019t result in anything great; only average positions at best. I have been trying for many years to get promoted or get ahead somehow, but nothing. No real opportunities. I have been turned down several times just because of lack of BS Degree, even though I have 120 credits since 2005.\n\nI hate when people assume stuff about me and then spread lies. This has been going on most of my adult life.\n\nIt would have been a normal request of asking you for a work position. But right before, I talked to Jeff Evanson of Investor Relations. I told him the extra question I was going to ask you and he said, \u201cThis is not the place for that.\u201d I told Jeff, \u201cHow much of a genius I was.\u201d Jeff responded something like, \u201cElon has good people around him.\u201d After some more words, that was it. I thought, how many \u201cCaps\u201d does Elon have around him? At that point I became frustrated. I thought when do things get better for me? I am trying to do good things for others. The shareholders thought I was taking up their time, they didn\u2019t realize I am here to give them time.\n\nMy 2nd question was supposed to be, \u201cI would like to speak to you for a few minutes afterwards on how I can help Tesla. You would benefit personally and Tesla would as a whole.\u201d But since I was frustrated, an emotional plea came out. And I am sorry for that. I had to say something. You said, \u201cThere is no Vice Chairman position.\u201d Well, you know, we can always create one.\n\nI felt disappointed, but got over it and went to lunch afterwards. I had a good meal and time with members of the Tesla Motors Club. There is a cool picture online. I am on the left. During lunch, it felt a little awkward. I told people that I was genius like Steve Jobs. I am no better than anyone. I am just beyond most people. I know you can relate.\n\nI respect Jeff Evanson and what he has done in IR. He has grown as a person, since meeting him 2 years ago. He is doing a great job. But he didn\u2019t realize how much I was at the bottom.\n\nTo be honest, I am actually a high level person on the inside; even though I look like a low level person on the outside. If you speak to me for five minutes on the phone, you can see that. If you meet with me for 15 minutes, you can see how much of very rich mind I am. You would be proud to know me. One skill you have is that can you assess people quickly. So can I.\n\nRecently, people have painted me online as some \u201cnut job\u201d or something, far from it. I am actually pretty brilliant. And I am hoping one day, someone realizes that. Maybe you will.\n\nI want to give you a little history about myself. And then talk more about Tesla and what I can bring to the company. So allow me to do that.\n\nI actually started on the Internet, back in Fall of 1995. I was a student at Temple University. About the same year as you I believe, I made a webpage. It was cool. I thought about making something like Yahoo.com. In fact I did, and had the site on Temple\u2019s webserver. It got a good number of hits, like 60 a day. I was really interested in the website, not really interested in school. I remember picking up a copy of Bill Gates book, \u201cThe Road Ahead\u201d. I read a few pages and thought, \u201cIf he can drop out of school and build a business, Why can\u2018t I?\u201d Well I quickly put the book down and ran off to CIS Class. Later, I got into some web design but more trading stocks.\n\nOver the years, I wanted to drop out of college many times, but everyone told me to stay in school. So I did. I focused on school mostly rather than my work. My big mistake, but I did what I was \u201ctold to do.\u201d I don\u2019t listen to people who \u201cplay it safe\u201d anymore. I have done that my whole life and have gone nowhere.\n\nWhen I look back on it today, that was potentially a $10 Million business that I could have sold and started my entrepreneurial drive. It was the late 1990s and the Internet was hot. I missed out on the Internet revolution simply because of poor advice from others.\n\nForward to 2004, the year I started on my self-education. School education has not really taken me anywhere. This is where my real \u201ceducation and enlightenment\u201d began. I read over 20 books that year: money, investing, business, etc\u2026I also learned that some people learn differently than others and that not everyone will pass certain subjects as easily as others.\n\nThat year is also when I became a \u201cgenius.\u201d I pursued music ventures that year in my company. For years now, I continued to learn. Many times I tried to find good work, but it was never available to me. Late 2008, I started to work in an Internet company as a Customer Sales Rep. The work was fine. Later, there was an opening to become a supervisor. I applied, but was turned down. The reason? The other candidate had a degree.\n\nI experienced this many times in other companies being turned down on a regular basis. I remember studying success and asking myself, \u201cWhat would make me most happy?\u201d I turned back to investing, something I started in college in 1997, but only started to really learn about in 2004.\n\nSince 2004, I have been investing in stocks, making some money along the way. I left my storage company job in 2012, where I was employed in customer service. Again, I always tried to move up in the company. I told my boss how much I learned on my own, but was turned down again for a possible promotion. When you are labeled as an average worker, you stay one I guess.\n\nI am nothing but average. Not only has my mind expanded since 2004, I also have learned more by entrepreneurial experiences. As much as I would like to work at a higher position, I would be given an entry-level position, at best. People always told me I am not qualified. And that always bothered me. They didn\u2019t realize who they were speaking to. I admit I was more in a low financial position, so it was difficult to try more entrepreneurial activities. I had made mistakes, but we learn from them and move on like Bonn-o-Tron.\n\nI just recently had a financial setback. Trading stocks is stupid and eventually leads to losses. I was better off managing stocks. But that wasn\u2019t taking me anywhere, either. It is funny I actually grossed more from the stock market, than I have with my college education.\n\nI actually had 1000 shares of Tesla at $24. But I listened to others, especially that JP fellow; when I should have listened to you more (my fellow Cap). Today, I admit I have 100 shares. I learned more now it is about long-term partnering, rather than short-term trading.\n\nI always told myself, I can always do \u201cinvestment management\u201d if the job ever came. But hasn\u2019t. I asked myself about \u201cpicking stocks\u201d, but something would be missing in my life.\n\nFast forward to today, 2014. I realize now so much how the world works. I have a much better understanding about money and business. My mind is clearer than ever. I am a capitalist. I am here to build and create in big ways. I have more street smarts now than book smarts.\n\nIn my own company, I wanted to solve a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in our society. If people knew what problem I was trying to solve, they would be giving me a \u201chug\u201d right now, instead of trying to \u201chang me\u201d out to dry. I care a lot about society and the world. I do appreciate some of the support I received, but much more criticism. People think that \u201c1 minute video\u201d is all me. That don\u2019t realize how much of a whole person I am. They would be surprised on who they are talking about.\n\nSome have criticized my \u201cCollege Truth 2\u201d videos. They have useful information. So what if I act a little goofy in them. I believe Richard Branson said, \u201cYou want to take your work seriously, but you don\u2019t have to take yourself seriously.\u201d How many people act serious, but yet don\u2019t do serious things?\n\nPart 1"

            "While I think your points are valid, working hard and smart aren\u2019t mutually exclusive; one can do both. \n\nI recognise myself in the last point, when I started with development. It\u2019s a usual noob-trait, similar to when little children just have learnt something and don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s help. I can\u201d-behaviour. Though, It\u2019s good to exhibit this to a degree to increase your learning, but it needs to be on a moderate level. \n\nNot using any library is a bit extreme (and a lie as you often need to use standard libraries in most languages)",
            "Good post.\n\nDepends on what \u201chard work\u201d means. \n\nI\u2019ve failed a lot, and have made enough $ to never work. \n\nWhat I know for sure: if you don\u2019t enjoy what you do every day you\u2019ll never actually be able to keep up with the competitors who do what you do out of utter joy. You just won\u2019t. \n\nThis said, what\u2019s \u201chard work\u201d? \n\nFor me it\u2019s both (1) doing admin, \u201cbusiness dishes\u201d, or getting around to tough decisions, things I *dont like*\n\nAnd (2), if I end the week having been packed with exciting meetings, deals moved forward, hiring strides forward, maybe I got out a pitch late one night bc it was on my desk to finish, etc. That\u2019s hard work too. It was fun and I did it for me.\n\nI think generally trying to do an endorphin pull forward is a winning strategy to help nibble on things needing to be done, to plow ahead when you\u2019re about to give up (ex \u201cgetting pumped at being 2% more of the way there when doing 3 hrs on something\u201d or acknowledging the pain you avoided by doing what you did - that\u2019s a mini reward).\n\nI wasted 7 years on a bad business before fixing it for good. Should have learned faster and been more *intellectually honest with myself*. There\u2019s a huge difference between iterating to win while focus my on the same end goal vs quitting all the time at the first sign of adversity and then totally pivoting. \n\nFinally I learned and I did something else that exploded immediately and has been a hoot.",
            "All of your numbered points are valid but I think you are actually backward when it comes to founders looking for the \"hard\" way vs the \"easy\" way. So many founders, yourself included, take the easier and more comfortable path of building what you like instead of what people want/need. It's a ton of hard work to:\n\n1. Research and understand consumer trends and behavior\n2. Validate ideas and actually talk to end users\n3. Get familiar and proficient with 3rd party code, tools, libraries, etc.\n\nIt's more about being willing to do the uncomfortable, frustrating, and difficult things you don't want to do than working hard vs smart. Very few people are consistently successful without working hard and smart.",

The idea of spending decades of working for someone else's vision literally kept hunting me at night.\n\nYour approach with the SaaS development is smart as hell. Building 5 products in 2 months is awesome so you can find product market fit. Most devs (myself included at first) make the mistake of perfecting one product for months without validating if anyone actually wants it.\n\nYou're absolutely right about solving real problems. The saas projects that really grow are always the ones that scratch a genuine itch. Solving your own problem proves this. When you're actually living the problem you're solving, you understand the pain points in a way no market research can match.\n\nCongrats on breaking through that first sale barrier.

I\u2019m also starting of 2025 with a new business idea \n\nThe Idea:\nHelperoo is an on-demand home services app designed to make it easier for people to book and manage regular services for their homes, cars, and even personal care. Instead of juggling multiple apps, service providers, and contacts, you can handle everything in one place.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works for customers and providers:\n\nFor Customers:\nFind & Book Services: Whether it\u2019s cleaning, gardening, car valeting, or personal care (e.g., massages), you can browse verified service providers, see their prices, and book instantly.\n\nTransparent Pricing: You\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re paying upfront. Services like cleaning will have fixed prices, while flexible jobs like gardening or personal training will be charged hourly.\n\nReal-Time Tracking: Once you book, you can track your provider\u2019s arrival and see updates during the service.\n\nSafety First: A built-in emergency button will allow you to call the police instantly if you ever feel unsafe when a service provider is at your home.\n\nHassle-Free Payments: Payments are processed securely through the app. A hold is placed when you book, but the payment is only finalized when the provider accepts the job. You can also tip providers through the app if you\u2019re happy with their work.\n\nFor Providers:\nProfile & Listing: Service providers can create a professional profile, list the services they offer, and set their prices.\n\nFlexible Work: Providers choose their own working hours and decide which bookings to accept.\n\nReliable Payments: Providers are paid directly through the app after completing a service, ensuring fair compensation.\n\nBuild a Reputation: Providers can earn ratings and reviews to attract more customers and grow their business."

You seemed to be more along the lines of the reward model where the person had to spend time in a mobile game to get rewarded (which then went to pay the streamer) vs the more classic model.  \n\nPicture in picture ads to support streamers would likely work really well and would more mirror how most in app ads works.  \n\nIt would move the streaming sites away from the YT ad model and more into the mobile in app ad model.  \n\nJust imagine popups on streams...\n\n> **Watch an ad to support this streaming?  Click now to support.**\n\nI cant be sure without testing but I bet if implemented well with something like picture in picture that loads of people would click them.

Since you become cash flush, the thought of running lean is a ridiculous concept! For myself I relate it to the feeling I get when gambling. If I hit it big on a bet, my instinct is to bet more instead of scaling back. I feel like it can be the same sometimes with companies, but what you said was so spot on   \"*focused resources on R&D to run rapid product experiments alongside our core customers to validate our ideas and improve retention*\" and \"*Keep things lean until you\u2019ve seen positive retention metrics!*\".

But it has an obvious limitation: it makes it very hard for you to get more value from each customer, and forces you to get new ones to make more money.\n\nThat might even explain why your EBITDA isn't higher.

I was mis aligned with the objective reality, focusing too much on my craft rather than searching ways in which I could align my business so I could better use my skills in a way that I could better help others. I was not listening enough to the opportunities in the market. Some ideas: where in the market creating BETTER content has huge asymetrical leverage. Think small improvement, huge gains. Maybe a sales page, maybe ads copy?\n\n2. There are lots of copywriters and content creators that have evolved their businesses into serving others. For example, take a look at Mike Shreeve (peaceful profits).\n\n3. I believe you'll benefit working with someone outside your business. Sometimes we're blocked into our own thougts pattern and we miss to \"see\" the opportunities in front of us.\n\nYou can DM me if you want to take this conversation further.\n\nSending my best thoughts your way!",

            "I'm a freelance copywriter, and I'm also feeling the pain of this downward market. But the challenges of running an agency right now must feel insurmountable. The constant pivoting to respond to this erratic market looks exhausting, especially when you can't land on a winning strategy because the goalposts keep moving. I've stayed small and avoided scaling (except to hire a few subcontractors for larger projects) because this need to be so reactive all the time feels insanity-inducing. I really loved this very thorough and transparent review, and I have such respect for your tenacity. I do think, given everything else happening around you,  that quality will always take you far. I also process by writing, and you have inspired me to start writing more about how my own business is going. Btw if you ever need another copywriter on the roster at Optimist, let me know! I write for another agency in a similar space, and we're always looking at the Optimist website for copy inspiration :)",
            "That was comprehensive.\n\nOne idea: consider diving deeper into audit-based marketing to land these clients. Offering a \"state of your content ops\" audit could open doors without locking you into full production mode prematurely.\n\nIn addition, I agree that AI is playing a role. However, one thing to mention is that AI is primarily helping small businesses or new entrepreneurs with low budgets. Larger companies often lack the expertise or time for proper execution. We help B2B & B2C companies to grow their social media and online presence and AI is not really impacting our agency.",

            "What a comprehensive overview, Tyler! Thanks for sharing. As a content agency owner myself, I found this extremely relatable. At some point, I thought it was written about us, lol.\n\nI'm not sure I understood it correctly: mind summarizing what exactly makes your closed system... closed -- both internally and for clients? How do these three dimensions -- scope, word count and deliverable type -- cooperate towards that goal? Maybe reverse-engineer a couple of real-life examples? I'd appreciate that, because I'm really curious about how this can be implemented in practice.\n\nWhat are the practical implications of this closed system? Is it more for internal operations, to simplify management of the content creation process, team, costs, etc.? Or is it more for client-service fit and more precise marketing and sales? Or both?\n\nDid I get it right that it all mostly boils down to \"you pay $X for\u00a0*up to*\u00a0Y words\", which allows you to be flexible accommodating various client requests without locking in on productized packages; and at the same time to make sure that whatever the client request, you can easily navigate your internal costs and adapt your workflows, which you previously figured out for each deliverable type?",

My recommendation, if you\u2019re not already considering it is, for AM\u2019s they should also be able to fulfill project manager roles too. If not don\u2019t hire them. My 2c \n\nBest of luck buddy!",
            "Dude, first off - respect for the hustle. Reading this was like a masterclass in building, burning, rebuilding, and somehow keeping your sanity intact. The whole \"everything is burning\" part? Yeah, felt that deep. It\u2019s wild how the content game\u2019s shifted - AI\u2019s out here flooding the market with cheap, mass-produced fluff, and suddenly everyone\u2019s expecting top-tier work for content-mill prices. Tough world.\n\nBut hey, on the topic of helping companies stand out, one thing I\u2019ve been working on might actually fit your upmarket pivot. [ConvoSearch ](https://convosearch.com/)(yep, shameless plug, but relevant, I promise) is an AI-powered product search engine for ecommerce sites. It helps customers find *exactly* what they\u2019re looking for, fast - kind of like how you\u2019re aiming to streamline complex content needs for bigger companies. Basically, it's about delivering value without drowning clients in noise.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m hyped to see where this new direction takes you. Keep fighting the good fight, and if you ever wanna swap stories about pivoting (or just complain about algorithms), I\u2019m down. Cheers, and here\u2019s to a smoother 2025! \ud83d\ude80"

            "Nice lander! For traffic to it, you can go pretty far with just posting to various [online communities for programmers](https://thehiveindex.com/topics/software-development/). Just do so in a way that's respectful to the community.\n\nIf you're collecting emails, I'd also try to get some more info besides the email. This can be either a \"select use-case\" field when filling out the form, or after you collect the email address, send a thank you email and ask what they are hoping to use the tool for and what they are excited about it. This is helpful bc people will have feedback right when they sign up, rather than months from now when you launch your product and they've forgotten they signed up for the beta waitlist.\n\nI'd also recommend talking to some folks in your ideal customer persona about their dev workflow, and specifically the problem you're solving. Here's a guide I wrote on [validation interviews](https://gummysearch.com/insights/idea-validation/). The earlier you do this, the less re-work you do with the product you build.\n\nBest of luck!",
            "Here's some ideas:\n\n* Initially, I'd reco. DMing devs and basically point-blank asking them if your product is something they'd use, find useful, etc. If I remember correctly, that's how a lot of software companies got their first few users - straight-up sales via DMs. Think Traction (the book) had something about this (amazing book, 100% recommend btw).\n* To drive traffic to the page, there are a ton of options. E.g. you can run ads to programming subs and be 100% open about what you're trying to do. That's how you get love on Reddit Ads. \"Hey guys, I'm making this app, I'd love some thoughts/feedback.\"\n* Think there were some subs for early users or idea validation, you can look for those.\n* You can make an \"asking for feedback\" post on the startups sub.\n* Find a developer Facebook group and straight-up ask for feedback on the app idea, if people would pay for it, etc. Add peeps who respond positively to your friends and hit them up when the app is live.\n\nRe: #2 - there's no way to tell, unfort. Some traffic might have a 20% opt-in rate, other traffic might have 2%. You can't really know whether you just got bad traffic, or there's not much demand for the product.\n\nRe: copy, don't have anything, not a dev, so can't give feedback here.",

I will do marketing during the validation stage. Content created through textbroker.  I have a VA in the Philippines I use for social media engagement.  The cost the site runs be about $5/month.

And I pretty much followed your steps instead of getting into the market first. 'Sales solves problems' is something worth remembering (it causes them too, but it's still a valid point). Lots of people and businesses will love your idea, but won't end up using it or wanting to pay for it.\n\nFigure out what your target market is and get some sort of prototype into their hands. You can do a hotspot mockup on InVision if it's app or web based, or you can build a front end using a web form that sends you an email that you send back the manually created results to. Building a SaaS solution is essentially automating a manual process, so do the manual process first to see if there's any sort of market for better performance. I understand this doesn't always work for what you might have in mind as your end product, but take little bits out of it to see if they have any value. It's going to help your final product anyway as you'll have a better idea on what the process will be, and identify and pitfalls early. Best of luck \ud83d\udc4d"

In the end, the strategy must be to implement a better offer, strategy, business model than the field, and be able to grow it in order to bring it to  a healthy profitable position.

The difference between a silent and vocal lurker is that the latter will speak his mind. The problem is his mind ain\u2019t ready yet but the mouth is already vocal. Therefore the vocal lurker spreads his own demotivating reasoning around.

Their main business is something else and they basically used their teams spare time and created this app. Many of this small apps that only run in one or two cities are actually just edited clones of delivery apps available on websites like codecanyon.\n\nThey also have a marketing team who somehow manages to convince the restaurant to also support them as they don't have to pay a fixed fee and they just charge like less than Zomato and Swiggy(the equivalent of Uber eats here in my country) so the restaurant owner doesn't mind.\n\nI used to use one such app because a particular restaurant was not serviceable on major Delivery apps But this one serviced it by charging an extra delivery fee which was more than double of what other apps would charge for their farthest restaurants.\n\nSo now if someone asks I am thinking of starting a food delivery app in my city then telling them they have no chance even though there are only 2 or 3 players who have covered most of the market is not \"killing\" the idea. Rather it is telling them that these 2 players have put in millions of dollars in marketing and are still not making a profit. They may break even after 2 or even 5 years.\n\nIts is for the person asking the question to understand(which you also failed to actually) and break it down using their own intelligence and common sense that what is really being said between the lines(or that one word \"saturated\") is that it may be very very easy to develop a food delivery app. Will cost you next to nothing.\n\nBut launching it and actually making it a success is going require lots and lots of money and you will have to pump in cash to increase your users in millions and not expect profit for years.\n\nYes even in over saturated markets that are driven solely by brand value and recognition and nostalgia that goes back to decades like chocolates there are new players who are emerging.\n\nThey have put in a lot of money behind branding and marketing.\n\nEven those that are purely online brands have also put in a lot of money into digital marketing.\n\nSo its not as easy as buying a temper machine and some moulds and making chocolate in your home kitchen and then wrapping it in silver and golden foil and sticking a small sticker with your brand and other required labelling. Many have startups have come like this and died down even though their chocolates may have been good.\n\nthey just wont hold up in a \"saturated\" market where their competition not only has the brand value but even the new startups are putting in so much money.\n\nYou can be a success if you have a funding. Here I will sum this up and rest my case ;-).\n\nYou will never see the word saturated being thrown around at a VC/Funding event.\n\nThey generally entertain proof concept and they also will listen to what strategy you have to make it a success.\n\nThey assume very rightly that you have already done your research as most of the time those pitching have done their research.\n\nThe initial rounds in these funding campaigns are to eliminate those \"reddit dreamers\" with an \"idea\" who's only research is asking on reddit if this is a great idea.",
            "Yea oversaturated is overused and when are we ever in front of the line to start something lmao like never. The best way to go at this is to acknowledge, \u201cThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.\u201d To put in context though, your entrepreneurial idea",
            "I own a cleaning company and that has to be the most saturated sector out there. Everyone and their grandmother has either a maid service or janitorial company. It didn't discourage me one bit.  I got out there and was persistent with my marketing, handing out flyers and speaking to local businesses. Slowly but surely I started to get calls for my services. Now I get a couple handful of contracts ever year through referrals, and my company is growing and going strong. Forget the over saturated hype, do what you have to in order to make your business become successful and it will work!",
            "Interesting topic.\n\nI remember back in the days when I was new to entrepreneurship that competition freaked me out.\n\nBut here's the truth:\nIf you have competition that actually means that the niche is profitable.\n\nWould you prefer jumping into a market where chances are higher for you to fail?\nI wouldn't.\n\nSo it all comes down to being self confident.\nSelf confident that you can make a difference in the market.\n\nAnd if you want to stand out?\nFind a unique angle how you can tackle your market.\n\nAlmost every niche has pain points that aren't resolved, or could be resolved in a better way.\n\nThat's where you jump in!\n\nMatt Giaro",
            "This is what we mean by market is oversaturated. Take a look at this list of startups from IndiaLook at the loss they are in millions from so many years.When they entered the market was not even saturated.  \n https://imgur.com/I96YQvU   \nYou see to enter such markets you need to have huge piles of money or funding.",

            "\\>  **In college I first heard Jason  Fried from Basecamp talk about how making money is a skill\u2014like playing  the drums or piano\u2014that you can get better at over time. That resonated  with me immediately. I wouldn\u2019t expect to be able to sit down at a piano  for the first time and immediately play a concerto.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis realization had the most powerful impact on my life. There were so many instances where I'd get frustrated with myself for not being able to make money from a certain business idea or venture. I'd always get so down on myself whenever I failed, while simultaneously comparing myself to all the people on social media who seemingly found success overnight by getting *lucky*. It wasn't until I read a few books, and came across the idea that money earning is a skill, like anything else, that I suddenly became calm with the whole process. I no longer saw making money as something only certain people could achieve, but something that can only be attained through practice and consistency. Thanks for sharing this golden nugget, it's honestly more important than any other form of advice that can be given on making money.",

            "Great write up. First worked in a supermarket.. then as freelancer.. then had an agency, now a SaaS. Glad to fit the roadmap!\n\nThe finances work out great. Steady and much higher flows. Growing every month. There are more benefits; in the agency customers had budgets. And wishes. And deadlines. Projects always had to be finished fast. Had a lot of trouble balancing those budgets, whishes and deadlines. To be honest, as a 25 year old kid I was used by quite a few experienced entrepeneurs demanding more for less. Learned a lot from that. Enough to want to find something else to do. Now that I\u2019ve found that I never want to go back.\n\nTo anybody under 30 reading this: you live now, you probably want to succeed now. I always felt like that too. But it is not important you succeed now. \nIt is important you\u2019re on a path where you learn to do better things for the next steps. So just not working for a boss and becoming a freelancer is already good. You have time. You\u2019ve been living \u2018 aware\u2019 for 10 years now tops. You have 10, 20, 50 years more and you only have to succeed once.",

I recently took a leave from school because I felt as though I hadn\u2019t really thought through my course in life and I really needed a sense of what is important for me. Like a lot of people said, making money does fundamentally feel like \u201cyou just need some luck\u201d sometimes and it made me really hopeless even while studying that it was possible to still end up in a bad situation after this. I was hoping that if I stepped away from school for a bit to study solidly on our life path here, that maybe i could find a better way than school and work for the rest of my life for someone. The part about being okay with trading time for money when you\u2019re starting out was big for me because it really did make me feel stuck and ashamed for feeling as though that was the only thing I could think of doing and it clearly isn\u2019t something my parents are happy with.\n\nIs there any books, YouTube, channels, podcast that you think would really help ingrains this perspective in my head?

However, rather than talk shit about this, I think personally you did a really good job. \n\nThat's not going to stop me from pointing out a couple things, though...\n\n1.) With YotPo make sure you contact your rep and get them to add rich snippets if you haven't yourself. This will really help in the SERP's and it's free. \n\n2.) You're sleeping if you're not using a 3rd party service like AHREF's. Yes, I realize that you could coast along fine with AMZN the rest of your days but you should really look at diversifying traffic and IMO, AHREF's is the best platform for competitive analysis and SEO...even better than MOZ! I still hate the price, though. To get the most value it's about $179. It's not that it isn't worth it, I'm just a cheap bastard and wish they'd let me have it for $29 haha.\n\n\nOk, now that that's said I'm still left wondering why you posted this.

            "Hey Tyler, \n\nI've read and re-read your previous posts multiple times through my own journey starting a content agency after being a freelancer. Your success is inspirational and I'd like to thank you for sharing your story as it really helped me. I like how you've been able to treat your staff well during your growth rather than exploiting them.\n\nMy thoughts on value pricing, to add on to what you mentioned - I've found that this stuff really needs to come out in live conversations with your prospect. You can't just have a flashy website or make 4-figure deals over email. It's a process of back-and-forth discovery that you need to get comfortable with and I'd recommend freelancers or small agency owners get comfy with phone/zoom time, even if they're super introverted.  \nAnyone else interested in value pricing their creative work would enjoy the work of Blair Enns, Jonathan Stark, and Chris Do - all give great advice on this topic. \n\nI have a question for you, and it's about the biggest hurdle for me: writing blog posts, even if they're obviously *really* high-quality, doesn't always have an immediate ROI. You might not even see an uplift in traffic until 6 months in if you're going down a pure SEO route. \nSo how do you think smaller outfits without the big case studies like yourself can make clients feel comfortable with relatively high investments, when we can't *guarantee* x% growth/pageviews/conversions over y timeframe?",
            "Excellent. This reminds me of a short note on value based selling I learnt from the personal MBA \n\u201cDoes it matter if providing a valuable service doesn't cost you much money? Absolutely not. Even if it costs you next to nothing to provide the service, if your value is higher than other services in the market, then that completely justifies a higher price.\u201d",
            "I write High Value Blog Posts ^^TM as well - I write content that gets picked up in the SERPS, drives traffic, and builds and email list.\n\nBut it usually takes around 8 months to get to where the article is really raking in traffic.\n\nSo...\n\nDo you get traffic faster by blasting your content with backlinks or do you tell them they have to wait for the article to rank?",

            "So I worked for a PR company that had a similar model. One of the founders proudly promoted on his personal blog that he \"didn't know or care\" how much a standard blog cost. To me, the price was much higher than I would ever consider charging and it eventually fell apart.\n\nWith that said, it sounds like you're hitting a lot of the areas that the company I used to work for didn't.\n\nA blog doesn't really do shit if it just sits there. Getting attention aside from organic traffic (which we all know is not that common unless you're a highly-recognizable brand) is huge. So if your blog price adds up to $1000 or so for a piece, then it very well might be worth it if you're taking other measures to get eyes on the content you produce.",

            "\"Can you track conversions and prove that your blog post will increase business growth by 10% like you claim? No? Then we will pass, thanks.\" that's where advice from people like OP absolutely fails. \n\nSorry, but I find pop entrepreneurship advice these days to be getting more and more misleading people into thinking that anybody can just redefine basic economics with such antics.\n\nThere's something called demand and supply for freelance services and all managers at client businesses learn to categorize these services and weigh the benefits against what they pay, or else they would go out of business real quick. We had content writers, consultants, and marketers use that line with us many times before \"we're not selling content/consultancy/social media campaigns... We're giving you growth, business, sales, actual cash flow generating conversions\". Well, guess how many were then ready to be paid based on the productivity of said services.... That's right, zero.\n\nWhy? Because (rightly) they say they can't measure the conversions from their blog post, or exact result of applying their consultancy recommendations, etc. So it remains nothing but a wild claim that is made by hundreds of content writers and doesn't go anywhere. \n\nSo the result is no sane entrepreneur with more than a month of experience would accept paying any extra for any such items when there's no backing proof that your so called blog posts produce more sales or results than the next guy. \n\nIn the end, we see some writers repeat this nonsense idea on forums to look good and sound like authority or that they're successful, and a few green hopeful readers read it and give it a try, but eventually get a reality-check when clients turn them down flat.",

            "Thank you. I really needed to read this piece, this morning.\n\nI am still in the \"soft\" opening phases of my local computer services company, that is not only onsite and offsite support, but also features contactless pick-up and delivery of systems, on a set schedule.\n\nPart of this is curating components to build specific CAD/CAM, Workstations and Mid to Higher end PC Gaming Systems. THIS is the one spot in my business where I am having some trouble with pricing myself. I am spending time curating components, confirming compatibility. Choosing the best power supply to provide good, clean power which increases system stability and performance. Choosing the best combination of case and fans to ensure proper airflow for system cooling. Finally, ensuring that the system is optimized for the hardware choices, including setting up conservative overclocks that mean any system I deliver will perform better than the majority of pre-built systems.\n\nAll of that is worth a premium and I need to not only start advertising my system building methodology, without giving away to many \"secrets\", to explain the premium on my system builds. Why should someone spend $899 on my \"Low-end\" gaming rig, when they can spend $699 to $749 on this or that pre-built? (Aside from not having to stand in line at the local big box retailers, due to COVID-19 Lockdowns.)  \nCharging appropriately is EASY when it comes to running LAN Cables, troubleshooting a small business network, setting up network printers, back-up systems, etc., etc. Nearly everyone locally charges an impressive dollar figure for the work and I'm happy to oblige by charging the same, but... while I do enjoy the Small Office/Home Office support part of the work.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to grow the business to a place where I can effectively compete with Origin PC, Maingear, NZXT and similar nation wide custom gaming PC assemblers. It just makes my brain dance to assemble the possibilities of PC gaming and workstations.",

We wanna have control, but also we're happy if the decisions are made for us, as long as we're happy with the results.\nToday, most of us consume music, TV, YouTube, and social media this way. Most didn't notice, but the share of the content from accounts you don't follow on social media keeps growing.\"\n\nThis is not true for me and I hate the way the internet is headed.",
            "I appreciate the post even though I'm going to disagree with some things here.\n\n> It turned out that we didn't really wanna make an effort to make decisions. We wanna have control, but also we're happy if the decisions are made for us, as long as we're happy with the results.\n\nEh, I don't know if I'd say that's the conclusion. Services like LastFM and Pandora that were completely about making good decisions for you fell aside in the face of Spotify where by default you have control and the recommendation features are a sort of side notes. When companies switch to a \"we'll handle what you want to see\" (like when each social media company did it), users generally complained a lot and it's often cited as the thing that \"ruined\" these platforms because it becomes hard to see what you want to see. Most people I know who left Facebook ultimately trace it down to something along the lines that they miss when their feed just listed out what their friends were doing. Same goes for YouTube. As YouTube spent less time showing your own subscriptions and more time curating a \"smart\" recommendation home page (rather than just per video similar videos), the home page has become lowest common denominator. It's hard to discover new channels. My wife and I, who watch basically none of the same things on YouTube have probably half of our recommendation as the same big few videos. Turns out the \"easy\" recommendation (something a lot of people like) is often not a good one (something that's a good fit for you in particular). Spotify had a similar story where when they first released the feature that keeps playing songs when your playlist ends, one band shot to the top of the the charts... not because everybody loved that band but because it was vaguely similar to the most other songs... a lowest common denominator recommendation.\n\nInstead, I think it's that recommendation-based interfaces are good for the business. One of the most common reasons it's good for businesses is now those businesses can sell influence (e.g. Facebook). Another is that if your library is incomplete enough that people will be sad if they just think of something and search, encouraging the \"look what we recommend\" keeps people in the box (e.g. Netflix). Netflix feels vast because it's really hard to just see a list of its content. If you just think of a show/movie and search for it, you will be sad as it's often not there. But I think the gap is really for platforms that give users more power because I think they generally miss having control.\n\n\u200b> doing the opposite of building single-purpose dev tools, which is: building all-in-one tools.\n\nI'm sure there is always some place for this, but I don't think it's going to be some big trend or really solves a big problem. \"Do one thing and do it well\" isn't just a description of what some environments look like, it's a core mantra of the UNIX philosophy and you can read decades worth of arguments for what the benefits of that are. In general, that it offers more choice, makes it easier to automate and allows those programs to actually do that thing really well. All that an all-in-one platform does for this is generally centralize (and therefore, often remove from the devs) control.\n\n\u200b> In the last 10 years, the engineering resource was the key. Companies with a huge number of developers and money to pay for that would be winning, since they could produce the best and most advanced software. Today the cost of making software is dropping rapidly. It's so rapid, that I can see noticeable change every month. I see solo makers launching a product in a month that would take a year from a team of 5 just 7 years ago.\n\nI don't think that's really true. This is why companies like Google and Microsoft are generally comprised of small teams and why their innovations are heavily driven by acquisitions, not in-house development. Throwing more manpower at the problem only solves a small subset of problems. It has always been the case that a small focused team can come up with a game changing, world-class applications.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Earn attention and monetize it.\" is really not a new concept at all. It was the basis for the dot com bubble where the thinking was that as long as you can get traffic, you'd be able to monetize it somehow. So, it's not really a bad recommendation to \"earn attention\" but it's not really anything new or different. The same was true last year, 15 years ago, 25 years ago and 200 years ago. There is a value to having a voice that reaches more places.\n\n> I'm pretty convinced that the data used by AI models today isn't 100% legally obtained. We all know the court case filed by the New York Times and other content owners against OpenAI and other AI models.\n\nIt's not that it's not legally obtained, it's that this is an undefined area of law so we simply do not know what is legal and what is not until the courts weigh in. If you see AI as simply a mathematical transformation on data like a camera filter, then it seems reasonable that you'd need rights to use the training data and may have to pay royalties in the resulting product. Meanwhile, if you see AI as \"intelligence\" similar to what humans have, then requiring AI to credit and license all of its sources is as unreasonable as requiring an accountant to pay royalties to a textbook company every time they use a process or skill they learned in college. Beyond that, even if it's decided that copyright applies, it's not clear how royalties would work in a case where we cannot necessarily quantify the amount of the input that an output used. That said, this area of legal uncertainty is probably a good place for a startup that can tolerate (and expect) that increased risk and we can expect that some larger companies may be keeping their distance to avoid the potential liability.\n\n> Whatever the outcome, it's pretty clear: owning the data will be one of the golden assets of the next 3-5 years. AI companies will be willing to pay a lot for it.\n\nWe'll also have to see how the privacy movement works alongside of this. AI mining has added more urgency to people pushing for data privacy laws, so it is pretty likely that whoever is the biggest data reseller for AI training will also end up on Last Week Tonight as the posterboy for villainous anti-privacy organizations. As stated above, we're probably on the cusp of having \"data\" law radically changed whether by courts or legislation. What the result will be is hard to predict. It may be extremely good news for data brokers or it may be bad news.",

Plus, emerging technology areas like space, blockchain, quantum computing, etc., provide plenty of opportunities for inquisitive minds, and the full potential and impact of these fields are yet to be understood. Even some fields in which there is a general public impression that everything has been discovered or understood have unsolved mysteries or unexplored opportunities that many are unaware of. NASA's citizen science programs are perfect examples of this (perfect, also because your username contains the word astronomer). NASA has started this initiative not just because they want to raise awareness and interest among the public about outer space but also because they face a very real shortage of personnel to keep track of asteroids that could collide with the earth or impact our communications satellites, to track dark energy in the universe, and discover clouds on the martian surface, etc.\n\nMoreover, as someone who likes reading on subjects like history, culture, and anthropology, I have a very clear understanding that there is much to be discovered and understood in these areas as well.  I also believe that there is plenty of wisdom hidden in the rituals and practices of ancient cultures around the world that they figured out through centuries of trial and error. Although these may not be monetizable ideas on the face of it, they are still valuable for research aficionados who consider knowledge and discovery as rewards in themselves. Or for someone who has enough language prowess to write the next international bestseller and popularize these subjects like Richard Dawkins or Carl Sagan did, it is monetizable as well.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for your POV on the matter.",

Keep getting out there, keep developing ideas, and understand that you're facing an uphill battle because 1) starting a new business can be super hard in general, 2) just because something looks like an issue worth solving to you doesn't mean other people will agree, and 3) it's very hard for adults to trust an 18-year-old with anything, nevermind their money.  But these are the best years for you to experiment.  Make mistakes.  Think creatively.  Find a way to utilize new technology that older people might not have considered yet.  Think of yourself like a toddler learning to walk and allow yourself to fail over and over until you get it right.  At 18 you likely don't have the same responsibilities as most adults, but this only means that you have a lot more leeway to take big chances and get super creative and LEARN FROM YOUR FAILURES.  By the time you're 25 you'll have learned A LOT more lessons than the average entrepreneur, and you'll be so much better off for it.

If there is a market you are passionate about, look at 10-20 competitors and their customers reviews online, specifically look for the 1 to 3 star ratings and why they gave that review. Then build your business around solving those problems and you will have carved out a niche in that space. Ultimately, building a community first is the direction to go.  Get good at doing THAT and then the community will show you what problem they need solved. Hope this helps.",

            "1. Read the post from the person the other day (yesterday?) who started and failed at something like 17 businesses\n2. I recommend checking out Starter Story. I just started the 4th AI Academy since I\u2019m still working on getting my (nth) business launched.\n\nI\u2019m not employed by starter story. I posted my story (Outlaw Soaps) on there and I\u2019m part of the community. I rejoined the AI Academy because I found the methods and framework for finding an idea, validating, doing user interviews, etc, very helpful and effective. So now I recommend it to people who are struggling to get things going.\n\nIn general, there are two camps of launching businesses:\n1. Launch fast and fail fast - to do this, you have to be a building MACHINE and never get discouraged if things don\u2019t go well.\n2. Research and craft - the stakes are higher when you do this, since the sunk cost (the time and energy and money) you put into the business will make it difficult to kill if it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. It would take many months to even come up with the business concept and revise it to be worth launching.\n\nStarter Story\u2019s academy is for people who are naturally in camp 1, but who aspire to be a little more like camp 2, which makes it helpful for me.",
            "It used to be said that there was no way to build a useful software for under a million dollars\u00a0\n\n\nThat problem has largely been solved by easier technology but it requires you know the technology or pay the price (a lifetime price) to learn how to do it\u00a0\n\n\nI can make you 10 SaaS software all from the same code base but I'm an old man with decades of writing code. It wouldn't be worth it for me to write it for you unless you brought something to the table or the idea was for social justice or the greater good\n\n\nSo it's highly unlikely at 18 you can write useful code for a SaaS unless you have been writing code since you were 10 (and even then).

At work each team has a workload and the supervisors can either manually review each person (guess) or manually count them. But there is no way for them to have a snapshot of the team (total workload, how many active, how many finalised, who has the most etc). The supervisors manually input each job on a workload in an excel sheet data and constantly update it for their team. It takes a minimum 30 minutes if you\u2019re a fast typer each week and you already have some data structure made . I built a quick excel macro and with 2 copy and pastes could do it in 2 minutes. In fact within 20 minutes I could do it for 10 different teams! Each supervisor gave me 5 for the program. \n\nWhen you make thing 10x or more faster- people will happily pay you. \n\n3. Skill- nobody at my workplace knows Excel macro. How many people do you know that do? Learn a valuable skill and you will be able to sell it. Google \u201cbarrier to entry.\u201d For SAAS the program isn\u2019t the skill- getting signups is. If I make a CMS do they really need it? How will it save them time than what they are currently doing it? Can you demonstrate it? \n\n4. Do some real market analysis and speak to real business owners. You\u2019ll be shocked by their needs. My friend makes 10k a month. Guess what with? Making better looking takeaway leaflets! They all said they were outdated and he said he could do it for them. He then learnt graphic design and bought a large printer and got to work. \n\nTLDR: speak to people, learn a hard skill and then use your skill to solve their genuine problem. DEMONSTRATE the problem solved.\n\n\nQuestions for you:\n1. What does your SAAS do exactly? How does it save someone time or money? \n2. What businesses did you approach? \n3. What can you demonstrate? Rather than saying I can make you a website- say I made a mockup website and show them it. Rather than saying this will save you time, do a trial and actually save them time.",

            "If everyone could build something with 2 weeks work to make $500 a month we\u2019d all be billionaires.\n\nA lot of people ask these kinds of questions. The reality is you can choose ANY market you want to get into. Here are a few important factors that will determine your success (in literally any field/industry/product you want to choose). The key is competing for current market share rather than trying to create a new product in a brand new market that doesn\u2019t exist. Anyways, here they are:\n\n-quality product\n-marketing strategy\n-building relations with potential clients\n-repeat\n\nYou will need to dedicate yourself and do it over and over and over. In my opinion, an idea is worth about 5% of the success of a product or service. The other 95% comes from execution, marketing, networking.",
            "The best smaller SaaS ideas I have seen come from people working in a specific industry and recognizing an inefficiency in the work they or their employer does and then creating a software solution for that inefficiency which they sell back to their own employer and competitors of their employer who would benefit from the software.\n\nWith that being said, I think the best method to find smaller SaaS ideas is to spend time in your current job and try to take note of things that you or your colleagues are doing on a daily basis that is/are highly inefficient and can be made more efficient via software. I'd choose one of these problems, build software to solve it, give it to your employer at no cost initially and if it works as intended, consider then charging your employer and offering the service to other competitors of your employer too. \n\nHope that helps. Good luck!",
            "There is nothing you can build in a few weeks maximum that will stick maybe you can get it to $500/month but it'll fade away very quickly. In terms of finding a small SaaS idea then there is a simple process. Think of yourself a customer in a large customer base (say a small web design agency). Think of all the different problems they have down to the nuts and bolts. Then think of a product that's super cheap but solves this problem very well.\n\nUsing the web design agency as an example: here are some problems they will have:\n\n* They want their clients to be able to very easily get in touch with minimal effort\n* They want to be able to effortlessly manage their existing clients revisions for designs\n* They want to be able to up sell other services once they have completed the design work for their client\n* They want to keep in constant contact with their clients so that they get repeat work with them\n* ... etc\n\nThese all could be turned into small SaaS ideas again for example:\n\n* A intelligent contact form that tries to automatically fill out details of clients. Plus point if it automatically connects to all the major CRM providers\n* Some kind of a small simple Project Management tool built specifically around managing design clients. Again plus points if it connects the to existing big players to pull in data quickly and easily\n* ... etc\n\nI would do this exercise first on paper write it out draw some diagrams and pictures of what you are thinking about and you'll start to get a clearer picture of the scope of what you are trying to do. This process could take 2 weeks in itself if you don't really know much and have to do research.\n\nAll of these are small ideas but will take longer than 2 weeks to properly implement. You could maybe get a skeleton up and running in 2 weeks but clients will be looking for something very polished so I would try to keep the set of features to a minimum for the first version.\n\nAnother note: there will already be products out there that already do what I am proposing but the point of your Micro SaaS app is to do them much much much much better than there version. If you think it will be very difficult to do that then move on to a different idea.\n\nMost important though is to take action start developing the idea and most importantly the execution of the idea. As people keep saying here it's not the idea that's important but the execution. The major players in any industry can't be as narrowly focused as you can so use that as your advantage. Also ignore the pessimists are naysayers small SaaS products are a huge industry and there is still plenty of opportunity to make significant money (way more than just $500/month).\n\nHope this helps and good luck !",

Maybe it's just a lot of folks simply are not good business people and don't survive the startup and growth phase.

But sticking to your original dream of being a company of one might be the best route.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. Exits will be easy\n\nFounding teams usually have many challenges when it comes to splitting equity. These issues could result in shaky exits that could hurt a company.\n\n2. Quick decision-making\n\nIt feels good when you wake up one morning, get an email from a company interested in your APIs, and just like that, you decide to sell. The situation might be different once a co-founder enters the picture. Before deciding on anything, every co-founder must sign off on it. And time is not your friend.\n\n3. Avoid internal conflicts\n\nCB Insights' analysis of 111 startup failures shows that internal conflict between founders (and between founders and investors) was one of the top reasons why startups fail. As a solo founder, you save yourself the headache that comes with internal conflicts.\n\nSo that\u2019s it.\n\nI strongly believe that anyone who feels they HAVE to have co-founders should think again. Not only have you shown that solo founders can make their ideas work, but others have also done it. Our team recently explored this topic in-depth and found some pretty interesting results when it comes to [solo founders vs. founding teams](https://tinyseed.com/latest/founding-team-vs-solo-founder).\n\nThank you for sharing your story and all the best with your new micro-startups. \ud83d\ude80",

He and I developed products together at the other startup so we had experience working together as product lead/Tech lead. \n2. When i contacted him, he loved the idea. The way we handled it was: we came up with the cost of the scope of work. I agreed to pay him off the top out of the first revenue until the job was paid, with an equity kicker and a personal guarantee if the work is not paid in 2 years. \n3. We sold our first $15k annual license when we released the beta which gave me the funds to bring him on board full time as CTO. \n4. The company sold last year for 8 figures.",

How much to give is something you need to decide and that person should agree to. Time to goto market is critical. So, use your CTO to get your MVP out to test the waters asap. Your efforts/time should go towards defining the key requirements and focus on marketing / selling your product. Also, don't worry too much about your CTO stealing your idea. Execution, including its sales, is important and that stealer err stellar of a CTO won't be able to handle it unlike you.\n\nAll the best.",

Could you kindly point out, of this list of companies and basically successful businesses, which started with absolutely no money at all?\n\nStarting a business, I agree. Anyone can start a business with absolutely no money. The unacceptable rest of the story is lack of funds is one of the very top reasons startups fail. Year in. Year out. Going back decades.\n\nThe ratio of dead bodies to actual success should get a mention. It never does tho.\n\nBut, as stated, you can start a business with little or zero funds. It's those little loopholes in these sayings that are a bitch-and-a-half.\n\n>People, you don't need to add more barriers to your life.\n\nRunning out of money is a barrier. Not being able to fund adequately is a barrier.

            "Great list! And congratulations on your success!!!!\n\nI'd like to add that starting a new business takes a certain mindset about money. I truly believe a lot of people don't shrug off their career (even if they hate it) and go on the solo business adventure because of their personal debt. Many adults believe that car payments for example are just part of being an adult and that car payments aren't really debt. Many people believe that you have to have some debt so you can have credit. Many people justify their credit card debt by airline miles.\n\nThe fact is that when you start a new business, every penny counts. And what counts is making money--not spending it.\n\nI know many adults in my field who can't cross over into our profession full time because they are so consumed with tax write offs and facebook brag posts that they miss the point entirely: profit.\n\nYes, the first 6 months are going to be very lean. That's why you start with no debt. Debt stress leads you to make illogical and costly decisions. Having no debt helps you stay relaxed. It keeps you focused on the goal: profit. No debt helps you keep the faith in yourself. No debt allows you to be creative in your problem solving.\n\nThanks again for this post. You listed some really great free resources!!",
            "I find that intelligence is only 30% of the battle. Most of the battle is laziness. In fact many people make up excuses like \"I can't do this without x,y, or z.\" What's really happening, is that they are procrastinating.\n\nI see entrepreneurs with half a brain, making money. It's more hard work than anything else. ",

MVP was never about the least you could possibly do the easiest, plus whatever less you can get away with. It was supposed to be about getting to know customers and a niche so intimately you could create a hyper focussed product just for that market. [A complete product.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P7nCmln7PM) \n\nIn other words, start with the assumption the final \"S\" in SaaS stands for Service. Say it to yourself as many times as it takes to believe it. No matter who says otherwise, insist that's what it means. Try being a competitor, because that'd be brand new. ",
            "Just do it and sell it better. SaaS is selling nothing for something.",
            "if you look at it that way, almost every market is saturated and nothing new can ever occur. truth is, almost every major company you can think of now iterated on an existing competitor's idea. at the end of the way, there are 100 different ways to approach the same problem and niches exist for a reason. execution, customer service, price point are all differentiating factors. i'd recommend reading the Blue Ocean strategy by the way...it can help you take an existing field and redefine it in some unique way. ",
            "There's SO much space still left for SAAS. \nThe best way and easiest way to do it, is to first BE in the market, and once you encounter a problem without a solution, you build it.\n\nI will give you a practical example:\n\nRight now dropshipping from AliExpress is huge, and most people use Shopify for it.\n\nHowever Clickfunnels is also huge (and has been around longer) and is amazing for one-click-upsells, which basically drive up the average value of each order you get.\n\nApart from that, Clickfunnels also has several advantages Shopify doesn't, so some prefer to use it.\n\nOnce someone places an order on Clickfunnels, there is no easy way to have the software automatically place the order on AliExpress - but with Shopify there is.\n\nSo either \n1) Build a direct ClickFunnels to AliExpress app\n2) Find a way to send orders form ClickFunnels to Shopify, and then use one of the several Shopify apps to order from AliExpress.\n\nThere technically are ways to do this right now, but they are still very flawed. Enter your saas.\n\nSorry if that didn't make much sense, but I was trying to give you a practical example. \n\n",
            ">because there's a lot of competitors out there. \n\nGood then. Because you already have an army of customers looking for what you are planning to offer. You just have to see how your competitors do it and try and make it better. That's lot easier than launching a new idea nobody realizes they need and then trying to sell it.",
            "When you start researching the market it definitely seems thst there's virtually just about any possible service for any imaginable problem. That's the first impression.Then, after trying some of them,you realise that either most of them are very so so or simply crap. We've got an internal solution we use at work.I was always very modest about it,while my manager was pretty optimistic of what it ca do.I did a bit if research and it turns out the vast majority of similar commercial solutions don't have these capabilities.I know quite a few companies pulling millions in revenue despite the fact that their offering is very average and brings thoughs like 'who would even use that'...",
            "I agree with a lot of the other comments - most things have already been done but there is often room for improvement. I tend to look at sites that I use day to day or that are already successful to identify features that may be missing or that could be done better. We have created many sites but as a simple example, we recently noticed that the social platforms (fb, Twitter, LinkedIn, G+ etc) do not allow users to directly create clickable social cards (without the use of meta tags on their websites) - instead when an image is posted it simply expands when clicked. We therefore created a free tool to resolve this problem. It allows users to turn any image into a clickable social card, linking to any website of their choosing. Although we have decided not to monetize the tool, it could easily be turned into a SaaS site. Here's the tool: http://anyimage.io and for anybody interested, here's how to use it: https://thewebsitegroup.co.uk/blog/create-social-cards/\n\nGood luck thinking of an idea!",
            "> there's always someone that's done it first.\n\nSo copy their working idea, piggy back off their work in proving that people will pay for the product and make yours like their's but better.\n\n Bring your expansive and deep knowledge of the sector to bear and provide a superior product. ",
            "There are so many things that separate one business from being more successful than another. Being first might just be one reason why, but there are a thousand other reasons why it could be better. In some cases first might actually be a disadvantage.",

            "I\u2019m not sure that the product is a bad idea, the problem might be something that you might not have given enough thought to. Let me try to share my perspective, maybe there\u2019s something here. \n\nYou are selling a tool for the terminal, with the hopes of allowing newbies to have a more approachable experience with this. Here lies the problem - you are targeting a very narrow sliver of an audience. Generally, most users, whether on macos or windows, will never have any contact with the terminal window. Those who do use it, generally either copy-paste commands from the internet, or are avid users and swear by it. These avid users know all of the commands then need, and so have no need for an intermediatery \u201cai tech\u201d to write commands for them. These users would probably find it hard to trust your tool. So, this is not your audience. Your target audience shouldn\u2019t be the copy-pasters either, given that they\u2019re often just looking for quick solutions to a once-in-a-lifetime (in their minds) problem; they open the terminal because of a step-by-step sequence posted somewhere on the web. Now, this portion of users might fall into your target audience, but this is a really small slither of the population.\n\nAfter all, what common user problem cannot be solved with a pre-installed GUI, or some other app a user can download, that can be solved with a terminal? I\u2019d argue that a problem like this doesn\u2019t exist. As such, I feel that it is expected you got really low traction with your product, given that 99%+ of your internet followers are probably afraid of the terminal. \n\nThis is fixable though. If it were me who would be taking this project on, I\u2019d find a way to target the largest possible target audience; those who have never touched a terminal. How would I do this? I\u2019d build a simple yet pretty GUI hosting nothing but a text box, and a suite of tutorials showing off examples of what your product can do. Bonus points (actually my starting position) would be to make this an iPhone/iPad app first. Clearly there are benefits to using your product vs using ChatGPT directly, as for example, you mentioned you can ask it to \u201cslow down this video 400%\u201d. \n\nIn the original Apple fashion, you need to be able to make something, but you also need to be able to sell it. Aka Jobs and Wozniak. \n\n[Take the time to start with the reason \u201cWhy\u201d you do things](https://youtu.be/u4ZoJKF_VuA), people don\u2019t buy what we do, they buy why we do it. Don\u2019t just jump ship at the first sign of difficulty - it\u2019s always hard at the start. \n\nTake care and good luck.",
            "First, the user base is small as some others have pointed out. \n\nSecond, you are using a subscription model for a terminal tool. There's just no way that's gonna work. \n\nI would suggest just put it on GitHub for free and add a donate button to your profile. You will make some money that way. Going forward, maybe you can build other products that have some interoperability with your terminal tool.",

            "Thanks for sharing your experience, many people would be ashamed to do so. I used to use the Windows terminal like A LOT. For several months, everyday I would launch at least 50-100 commands on the terminal so I was perfectly being part of your customer persona. That being said, it was never a problem for me to find the right command to launch since I had a text file with all the commands that I would need, so I just had to copy paste the command and change the options. Also, many times I would just open the Windows terminal, press the \"Up\" arrow to get the history of the commands I ran before, and select the one I needed.\n\nSo I think your biggest issue here is idea validation. I think successful tech companies solve frequent AND painful problems. However I think this problem is not painful for users even if it might be frequent.\n\nAlso, I don't think the argument \"check if the product already exists\" is generally good, because for any problem, if the market is big enough, it will be ready to absorb multiple competitors.\n\nGood luck for your next projects \ud83d\udc4d",

In the 2000s, with the rise of the Internet, command-line interfaces continued to be relevant, with developers using tools like Git and SSH. This trend has continued with new technologies and use cases emerging regularly. Despite the rise of GUI, the command-line market remains an evergreen industry, adapting to new trends and technologies.  \n\n\nYou should focus on having a clear and compelling Value Proposition.

What would be your take on checking the potential market for want? I do a lot of bartering and trading for side cash (cars, mowers, electronics, etc) and get sick of digging through Facebook marketplace and Craigslist where most ads are people asking ridiculous amounts of money for junk. A lot of people like to just trade items because perceived values are different for different people, and you can gain value without having to have the cash. Maybe trading labor for an object etc. \n\nI\u2019ve asked friends and people I know that trade about this idea, and I\u2019ve posted in groups of people that like to trade. I\u2019ve received a 50/50 mix of responses. My idea is an application or website that would provide a solely trading based marketplace. Some people have said they would use this. Others have said it\u2019s an idea, but have blown it off as being something that won\u2019t ever actually be created, due to me being thought of as a \u201cwantrepreneur\u201d as you say.\n\nMy competitor research has shown that there are only a few apps on the market that are based on trading. They all seem to have the option to sell items for cash, or just have bad user interfaces which makes them as useless as the big guys that won\u2019t ever limit the selling marketplace. \n\nI\u2019m not opposed to getting down and dirty and learning the skills required to create something like this. I don\u2019t have coding skills, the farthest I\u2019ve gone is building a couple Wordpress websites and blog that didn\u2019t have much success.

The owner even tried to sue for breaking the lease. (Laughed out of court)\n\n$70,000 loss. The other time on a building, we had to change the occupancy. We were only in about 70K for internal painting, fixtures, that stuff. Again, nothing anywhere indicating a problem and there was no way we could have figured it out unless we had known and no one in the last 30 years had done anything with the occupancy. We were the first business to check. We found out the structural/engineering plans had been destroyed in a fire at the municipal planning department in the 80\u2019s and the original builders had lost their copy. In order to get the occupancy charged we needed to provide structural plans. For this, we would have to hire an engineer to survey the entire building at about $300,000.

You were the initiator and lead, the founder and owner, and primary or sole investor in dollar terms. \n\nOther people invested in time terms.\n \nAs in, you may have put in funds, they gave you their time. Sometimes, the time is worth more than the funds. But perhaps they don't know that, and are only focused on the funds. Did you ever tell them that their time was worth more than what you were paying them? \n\nThere are many ways to mend bridges, so to speak.\n\nIf the entire work and business arrangement was clear and a straight forward and legitimate operation, you've probably got a lot of good will with the developers, even if the CTO has done something subsequently that was more about them than about you.\n\nNote: \n\nI've been in small business and microbusiness and working to do services for industry and even servicing company equipment for government departments, for over 25 years. \n\nThere is no real way to say this lightly. \n\nYou're not going to get anywhere with a budget of $200,000, unless you're literally slaving yourself and your staff for years at starvation level (or are vegans who meal prep, and meditate for relaxation, and who live ultra-simple lives)\n\nIf you're making equipment, you're going to need more income. \n\nI've some simple inventions, totally unique, not patented, so easily patented.\n\nI'd probably need over a million in investment to even begin to start one of them. \n\nActually, some of them have engineering requirements that I suspect would take millions before a single sale was made, and that would be if I was lucky or had incredible teams to help recruit engineers, even if they were available and competent in those fields.",

My best advice is to choose a developer for CTO who you have worked with extensively in the past.

By that logic you choose the biggest market and try for broad appeal, but that is exactly the formula for failure.\n\nIn contrast, you're better off finding a very small niche and dominating it, making it as small as necessary such that you are the only one they talk about because you got the solution just perfect.  That means getting to know the needs of that specific subset of users and really aggressively adapting the product for them. \n\nIf you follow some of the advice in that guide, you'll be better positioned to figure out what needs to be built through what is essentially cold calling and emailing, but for the purpose of customer interviews rather than straight sales. \n\nTLDR:  You don't want to shoot for .00001% of a huge market with a generic product, you want to shoot for 90% of a smaller, very specific market then expand if you can.

            "A few people DMed me for the tools I use to build/market MVPs and prototypes. In no particular order:\n\n* **Framer (**[https://framer.com](https://framer.com)**) to build landing pages and sites quickly**: Framer has all the benefits of Figma for intuitively designing nice websites quickly, and also lets you publish the site live directly through their platform. It\u2019s ideal for getting sites up fast while being powerful enough to make the edits and features you\u2019ll need down the line. It also has built-in analytics, payments, and everything else you actually need to validate initial interest for **most** startups.\n* **If you prefer open-source options, use WordPress.org (**[**https://wordpress.org**](https://wordpress.org)**).** You\u2019ll still need a domain and hosting, but it also has some interesting plugins that can save a lot of coding work in certain cases. Like Framer, WordPress has a lot of themes out there, but you might need to pay for a nicer one. There are lots of marketplaces that sell them like Themeforest etc. and they\u2019re generally affordable at a one-time price.\n* **Shopify (**[**https://shopify.com**](https://shopify.com)**) if you want an all-in-one ecommerce site**, especially with multiple products, Shopify is another good option that takes care of pretty much everything under one subscription.\n* **Mailchimp (**[**https://mailchimp.com**](https://mailchimp.com)**) to create your email list + keep in touch**: Mailchimp is an email list service. While it\u2019s not the cheapest, it has a free plan that\u2019s large enough for initial validation, and is widely used to the point where any other tool you\u2019ll use should integrate with them. Sendgrid, SendInBlue and a bunch of other options have similar functionality, and I just use Mailchimp because I'm familiar with it. They all should have free trials and I'd recommend going with whichever established option you prefer. \n* **Pipedream (**[https://pipedream.com](https://pipedream.com)**) and Zapier (**[https://zapier.com](https://zapier.com)**) for automation and connecting with APIs :** This is product-dependant, but I\u2019ve found Pipedream extremely useful for making hacky automations that work well for MVPs. It basically lets you build workflows where a given event triggers a series of steps that are prebuilt to interact with different services/APIs. For example, you can automatically add new users to your customer lists, or build workflows that interact with APIs like ChatGPT, Google Sheets, databases etc.   \nZapier is a bit easier to learn and has some integrations Pipedream lacks, at the cost of being a bit harder to integrate with your own code. \n* **Google Analytics**: there are better alternatives for certain features, but GA overall is a quick to set up option that\u2019s important to measure how people are responding to your site. For example, whether they\u2019re leaving immediately on the home page, beginning checkout, and so on. This is less necessary if you\u2019re using a platform like Framer or Shopify that has Analytics built-in, but I find GA\u2019s data is a nice way to see how people are responding to the site and diagnose potential issues.",
            "Really interesting. I haven't yet managed to launch anything due to a lot of what you say here, the constant thinking, tweaking, trying to ensure it's all perfect and ready for the millions of customers I anticipate flooding in. Then run out of time, funds and enthusiasm for that particular idea.   \n\n\nWill certainly take a look at the suggested reading and take the points into consideration for my next venture.",
            "> selling before you build\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nI work for a digital magazine publishing platform (among other things) and all new publishers to the platform go through a series of live courses on the business of magazine publishing. Class #2 is a full hour-long session on creating a one-page document that is foundational to a successful pre-launch.\n\nAn hour might sound like a lot but in magazine publishing, you absolutely have to sell both readers and advertisers well before your inaugural issue ever hits the shelves, or in our case the App and Play Stores.\n\nThe pre-launch sets new publishers up for a successful launch, so we spend a lot of time on it, not just the one class.\n\nIt sounds like that's essentially what you're talking about, so yes, absolutely.",

            "Thanks for the writeup\n\n>I recommend organizing your goals into weekly sprints to start\n\nAh, can't escape that even when being paid zero\n\n> much better to get a hacky product out faster than spend months building something your customers don\u2019t want\n\nThis depends on your level of technical expertise",
            "I agree 100%.\n\nI've built many projects, a few to great success.  I often had to explain to the high end devs I hired that it's ok to do it wrong.\n\n'But what about tech debt?'\n\n'That's what I'm here for, I get to decide how much debt is acceptable.'\n\nSome of these younger kids can't get past it mentally.  There is only one way to do things right.  But in business, you make compromises to meet the appropriate goal.  If I want to spend $5M in a year to rebuild it right, I will - If we don't ship next week, it won't matter because we aren't going to close the investor check we need to stay in business.",
            "u/Low_Cobbler4631 \n\nThanks for sharing! \nI am aware of that tactic but haven\u2019t tried it myself yet. \n\nDid you go about testing for demand via a \u201esmoke-screen\u201c-website yourself? If so a) what demand is enough demand to count as validation? b) how do you know that your ads leading to the website are legit and not the cause of the problem in case nobody hits the buy button?

I decided to create this company AFTER I landed my first $10k client, but the first project is much more in-depth as I am at the development stage of the park, and the marketing components I am creating will also help them raise the capital to fund the park.",

            "Good advice and common sense.\n\nMy brother opened an Ebay business before it was a thing. Many years later he is on most of the platforms and does about 3 million in revenue. I was jealous and spent years hating my job. I went blue collar. I became a Master Mechanic, got an AA, bachelors, MBA, Blackbelt six sigma, Certified \"niche industry\" manager. \n\nI left a job that paid $150k to make $72k. I went from  400 million in assets under my direction to 8 million. I did that because I wanted to use a small company as a test for modernizing an industry. This would be my track record for consulting. \n\nI started consulting on the side. The oil market crashed and businesses were dying left and right. I thought \"oil wont be down forever\". So when everyone else was closing shop I spent my savings starting a business. A blue collar business. \n\nYear 1: $87,000\nYear 2: $575,000\nYear 3: 3.8 million\n\nI am now part owner in seven businesses. All blue collar. I discovered something.\n\nBlue collar people know shit. They know far more shit than SEO goons. What they don't know is how to start, operate, scale, and build a profitable business. They are plumbers and not business owners. I am a business owner that operates in a plumbing sector. I am a business owner first. \n\nThe tech industry life cycle is in maturity. It is oversaturated and so is ebay type businesses. Automation is going to kill off these industries. \n\nIt is very difficult to kill off blue collar jobs with automation. By blue collar I am talking about plumbers, electricians, mechanics. In fact....who do you think is going to fix automated technology and equipment.\n\nIt is hard to find young people to work blue collar jobs. I pay $52,000-$95,000 to good blue collar workers and they have no college debt. They can buy houses, cars, and stuff because their debt to income is better. \n\nThey can start a business and partner with someone like me and be making decent revenue in just a few years. Huge demand, big barriers to entry.\n\nSell your T-shirts and send me the plumbers of the world.",
            "This is gold. I am working on something on the side right now. I have worked 3 years for the man so far and I have learned a lot at my job. A lot of the things I wouldn't have learned on my own (because there really isn't any way I would have been exposed to them). I was compensated fairly well so I have no regrets.

As if getting clients and actually getting paid and actually making a living and having employees is some how not legitimate.\n\nThey're these SEO Ninjas jerking off to blackhatworld everyday and eventually coming to me for a job when they need to actually pay their bills. I was lucky to learn this from working on my own businesses with some short stints learning from working for others - but I've always tried to surround myself with people who are better than I am at things. And thus far it's worked. \n\nI always say - I can write but I'm not a writer, I can build a website but I'm not a developer, I can take a photo but I'm not a photographer - knowing what you are capable of and what your limitations are is key - but as you develop all those skills, you become someone who can run a business and see through this bullshit.",

            "Despite me being an \"SEO consultant\" I couldn't agree more about that what you said about SEO and the entire thing. \n\nWorked the corporate world for a couple years after grad school, quickly realized it wasn't for me and I knew that from the start. Wanted to work for myself. Left with no real plan to force myself. Quickly got into SEO. Built a website, in one month I ranked top 3 for every SEO keyword in my major city.. two months to be #1. I haven't done shit on my site in a year besides update WordPress.. still #1. Made me realize how bad SEO companies are. \n\nThree of the biggest digital agencies here called me to outsource their SEO to me. Every meeting I ever had I leave realizing these guys are all complete morons. I am a true student in business and don't think I'm smarter than anyone nor have an ego and want to learn from anyone successful... but these guys were really complete god damn morons. It's like I was the only one who knew anything about internet marketing. \n\nI see all these scam artist bullshit online marketers always trying to sell the the next big thing and scam. At first it sounded awesome, now I see it for what it is. \n\nThe last 3-4 months I realized exactly what you said about if you knew SEO you'd be making money for yourself. I average around $30-35k a month.. the biggest issue for me starting a new business has became time over anything else. Actual time lol. Working 80-100 hour weeks is the complete norm. I'll admit I'm the beginning I didn't work as hard, not even close. The harder I worked the more opportunities came, the better I became, the more money I made. I blame myself for not being even further rather than dicking around for a year. \n\nI pretty much stopped taking any client that is under 5k/mo. The one good thing about doing SEO was I was able to expand my skills far beyond SEO to many things in the digital marketing word and worked with some insanely smart people as well. \n\nGreat post and gave me a little extra kick in the ass this morning.

            "I sold two large businesses I owned in early 2015. I spent 8 months prior to that planning the handover. After that paper hit my bank account, I booked a plane ticket to Asia. I actually selected 9 places in Asia that I wanted to visit. I planned to spend the next 5 years doing nothing but swimming sleeping in and just travelling with no real purpose. \n\nI travelled for 6 months enjoyed every moment of it and even brought a friend along for the ride. He had full travel and hotels paid for (bros for life) but when we came back home and I had spent the following 2 weeks watching movies, listening to albums, sleeping and playing video games I was restless I couldn't do anymore cafe brunches with my friends in between their lunch breaks.\n\nMy free time and complete freedom made me out of sync with my friends who had to make the 9-5 and couldnt just go to the beach because it was a nice day. The days I spent wandering around my home tending to my garden and house chores with no purpose. These days were not fulfilling, the days I spent asleep or listening to music while trying to sleep on the grass by the river were not fulfilling. These days were great to recover, but recover from doing nothing? that doesnt sound right If i had worked my ass off the day before then those times would of been more rewarding.\n\nI craved purpose and saw my drive to succeed plumet. Im a hands on guy I like to help people problem solving and making things happen are what drives me. I am in no way an entrepreenuer <- I struggle to spell the word and could never associate it with me as a person, Internet marketers have ruined the word for me I'm far from that. Ive started many businesses and Ive sold all of them. \n\nIf you want to really want to make it you need to look past the money. I'ver never been a money guy, I would rather help someone do something they can not do than watch them struggle. I started a small 1 man 2 outsourcer marketing agency I knew little about SEO and PPC  except my old ecom stores form 2006-2009 those techniques that are outdated. I came from industries way apart from what Im currently doing, the learning curve is steep but Im resourceful and I learn fast. Fast forward 16 months and im at the top of my game in an industry I was out of touch with.\n\nI could not be happier with what Im doing right now, I work 12 to 14 hours a day helping businesses and store owners get results and it truely satisfies more than any job Ive held in the past. I know business, Im great at sales and I know the importance of processes. Now Im helping franchises with their marketing mainly search and paid traffic but I make time for the little guys and give away more free information than I should.\n\nLearn skills that make you a better person\nBe fluid like water in a glass adapt with changes\nBe happy if you hate your job you need a new one.\n\nGreat post Granto I admire anyone that takes action.\n",

It's a dictatorship, and I'm happily oppressed.\n\n2. **Ideas? Disposable.** Today's genius brainstorm is tomorrow's garbage. I'm like a magician \u2013 ideas up my sleeve, and poof! Gone with the dawn if they don't cut it. No strings attached, no looking back.\n\n3. **The Magic 1/99 Rule.** Slap together a tweet, attach a Stripe link, boom \u2013 cash starts rolling in. Who needs polish when you've got speed? Built a website in my sleep, practically. Grabbed a template, AI vomited some content, and presto \u2013 instant storefront. If it's not quick and dirty, I'm not interested.\n\n4. **Simplicity Reigns.** My toolkit? Basic as a kindergarten lunchbox. Why? Because time's too precious, and I'm too impatient. If the tool doesn't fit, I quit. No time for fussing over fancy features that no one's gonna notice.\n\n5. **Set It and Forget It.** If an AI can do it half-decently, I'm sold. Why drown in advanced tools when I've got robots for minions? Efficiency over excellence, always.\n\n6. **Analytics? Yawn.** Who cares about number-crunching when you're starting from zero? My eyes are on the prize: traction. Until those numbers start singing, analytics can take a hike.\n\n7. **Ideas Are Easy.** Henry Ford had it right. Just build something better than the last guy. No need for homework; just sell a better mousetrap. And make sure you're the mouse's best friend.\n\n8. **Focus on the Hook.** Nail the first impression, and you've won half the battle. Features? A sideshow. It's all about that killer hook that gets them every time.\n\n9. **Lazy Marketing.** Conferences? Cold calls? Please, I'd rather watch paint dry. I charm my audience with wisdom and wit on social media, letting SEO bots do the heavy lifting.\n\n10. **Keep Pricing Stupid Simple.** One price to rule them all. Complex pricing models are for people with time to waste. Not this entrepreneur.\n\n11. **Just Do It.** Plans are for planners. I act on impulse, thrive on chaos. Multitasking is my middle name, and procrastination's my sworn enemy.\n\n**The Future?** With AI and NoCode leveling the playing field, the slowpokes are headed for extinction. It's a fast-paced world, and only the speedsters will survive. So, strap in, hold tight, and let's make some noise. The era of the rapid-fire founder is upon us, and it's blazing glorious.",

Also unlike other RPGs, the rules are backed by a game engine built in Excel to ensure balance and fairness.\n\nAt the end of 2024 I finished the core rule-book. (Version #0.663 but it's quite polished.) But I'm more of a game designer than an entrepreneur and I'm not really sure where to go from here? I could definitely write the next rule-book (the one for the game-runner) or create adventures; both supplements are well underway.\n\nContinuing to develop more of the game is fun, but now seems like going in circles.

            "If you've been making $250-$300k per year \"for quite a while\" then you are doing great, especially if every year is better than the previous one.\n\nIn an online business, you are competing with the whole world, that is true, but everyone in the world is a potential customer also.\n\nIn an offline business, you are competing in the local market, which is much smaller, less competition but less potential customers also. Can you make more than $300k per year in an offline business? Yes, many people are able to make much more than $300k in offline businesses.\n\nIf you can make $300k by blogging, digital marketing, affiliate marketing etc., then I think you can do just as well in offline businesses too, if you are good at sales and marketing.\n\nJust do some analysis first. For example, if your offline business can only provide landscaping services to 2000 people, then the chances of making $400k/year are slim because not every property owner will be your customer. Even if you do have 2000 customers, then you need to have equipment, employees, and other expenses too, etc.",
            "Risk vs. reward. Old economy businesses thrive and society always needs them. Many of them are high-touch and require a dedicated owner-operator to keep them humming well. The benefit of online businesses is they can scale easily once you have the machine working: marketing -> sale -> profit. Add more dollars to marketing and the machine keeps working, until you hit the max marketing spend curve.\n\nOnline is very cutthroat and they can suddenly be unprofitable for a variety of reasons. For example Google changes the ranking algo and now your blog\u2019s organic reach goes to zero, no more conversions and ad dollars. Happens a lot. \n\nHonestly it\u2019s really about what interests you, because buying dividend stocks would be much more reliable and less risky than operating a business. You operate a business because you want to work, not to take it easy.",

The con of real estate is that I would be tied to my local market, at least for representing buyers/sellers. Once I get into investing, I can branch out into other markets and be less tied to my local market. \n\n  \nIf I go into real estate, I already have the skill, and would just need to take my marketing to the next level.

All your advice are legit, so was hoping you could give some additional advice:\n\nStarted on 2016 as a side thing that got traction but nearly died since I was prioritizing my full time job. Now the company has been my full time job since january. Grossed 3k in december, and 14.5k last month (looking to gross between 17 and 19k this month). Nps is at 90%, main product line at 4.8 stars, Gross margins are at 80%, contribution margins are at 60%, ad spend is ROI positive at the moment, but the bottom line is a net loss due to fixed costs (office rental and ad agency mainly). The plan is to keep growing at least 20%MoM till I hit 50k in december with 10-15% ebitda, then start seeing growth rates go down MoM during 2023, ending the year at 240k gross (with like 20% ebitda margin). Hoping to get there by focusing hard on marketing & sales (paid ads, influencer marketing, events, maybe try some offline initiatives) and product development (improving existing product lines and expanding to new ones that are related).\n\nDoes this sound like wishful thinking to you specially the growth from 50k to 240k next year?

I know you've mentioned the limited size of your country, but people still do business there and SaaS works in a lot of different fields. Pick one - like, pick dentists. Get a VA to scrape a list of dentists in your country and send them a cold email - ask if you could talk to them and learn about their problems and difficulties with a goal to see if you can build something to solve it. \n\nGet your ideas from people with pain - find the pain by asking. \n\nI know I'm oversimplifying the process, but this is step 1 after all.",

            "A 12% conversion rate for essentially basic lead \"i'm interested\" sort of thing is a very good start after one round of optimization.  Realistically, you can grind hard to get that up to around a 15% rate, but you aren't going to ever see anything like a 30+% cr.  That sort of conversion rate is unheard of unless you have massive brand equity.\n\nI would now work to qualify the interest leads to see what they might be interested in/need and what pricepoint.  Price is everything in SAAS.  Ultimately, retention is key (reducing churn is far more important than increasing initial acquisition conversion rates).\n\nSource: I've founded and run several online ad agencies, after extensive experience with the first paid search engine. So lots of experience at landing page metrics across industry type.",
            "Depends a lot on the value of the action. Ideally you want to validate the idea using buying intent (e.g. clicking a buy now button.)  What you want is to test conversion rate to an actual sale so that you can get an idea of your cost of acquisition. \n\nFor example, if you're paying $1 cost per click and you are getting 5% conversion on that traffic, then your customer acquisition cost is $20. If your customer lifetime value is more than $20, you're in good shape. \n\nIn reality, figuring out CAC and LTV is difficult, but in early stages you can run a few tests and make some conservative assumptions to figure out if the idea has legs. \n\nHowever, I'd be careful in how you make assumptions when you're testing something other than \"buy now\" intent.  Signups for emails and other \"I'm interested\" intents have pretty low conversions to sales in most cases. Use very conservative assumptions. "

The uncertainty about making money and finding the right path is rough, but you're definitely not alone. It's normal to question things when the fruits of your labor aren't showing yet.

That\u2019s why marketing is important.

            "New to Reddit - this is the best post I've read in the 10 minutes since joining - thank you!",
            "Some great points here, and well done on your success to date!\n\nIf someone were asking me \"what business should I start\", I would add:\n\nMost people who haven't ever started a business (and many who have!) will overestimate the payoff. And underestimate the risk.\n\nThere is always risk. So try to minimise it.\n\nHow?\n\nHere are 2 big risk when you\u2019re starting a new business:\n\n1. Risk 1: your idea is crap.\n2. Risk 2: your execution is crap.\n\nEither:\n\n* No one wants what you\u2019ve got; or\n* You can\u2019t get people to want it;\n* Or both.\n\nThe problem is, if you\u2019re not succeeding, how do you know whether it\u2019s you, or the idea?\n\nHow do you know whether to keep persevering? Or pivot?\n\nThis is because, IMO, idea risk includes so many unknowns it's virtually impossible to really know. This is a problem, especially when you're starting out.  \n\nLot's of people like to think they should go big, or go home. But don't realise that the overwhelming majority of people who do this... just end up going home.\n\nSo IMO when you're starting out, and/or your tolerance or ability to absorb risk (and failure) is lower, it's best to minimise *idea risk*. \n\nFind an established need. Start there. Because that only leaves you as the variable. The execution risk. And you can control what you do a lot better than you can control whether people will like an idea, or not.\n\nThings like:\n\n* Businesses want more customers.\n* People want more money.\n* People want higher paying jobs.\n* People want to lose weight.\n* People want entertainment.\n* People want skills that are valuable.\n\nThese are all established needs. The idea risk is low. Which means you can start a service-based business, or a product, and just focus on getting better at the skills you'll need to do well in business.\n\nEliminate as much idea risk as possible, pick something you know people already want, and focus on the execution.\n\nWhich usually involves just doing 'more.' Unpopular, but true.\n\nMore reps, more cold calls, more conversations with potential customers etc. \n\nMORE FEEDBACK. \n\nJust do more, with a proven need, and and the biggest risk is what you're willing to do... you'll learn how to decide \"what business I should start\" next.",

            "I really needed to hear this today. Thank you for writing it up. \ud83d\ude01 I have not been grateful enough for the job that I currently have. You're right, this isn't some kind of punishment or failure, this is me learning and growing, developing skills in so many areas and becoming more and more ready to *really* succeed when I find the opportunities.",
            "Good post! And seriously, there's lots of generally good advice I agree with. \n\nBut I fundamentally disagree with your top level premise here that asking those questions are wrong and that \"starting a business is seeing an opportunity and taking it.\"\n\nThis is a really limiting philosophy that will be bad advice to a large portion of this sub. I think it applies to people who have a similar mindset and approach as you do - but it's not generalized advice like you're presenting it here. \n\nI say this for two reasons. \n\n(1) Having the ability to recognize a unique, profitable business opportunity staring you in the face is a skill. Not everyone has it, and it's completely unnecessary to carving out success.\n\n(2) It's a huge economy and there's a zillion entrepreneurial paths to levels of success your describing here. My path emphasizes strategic planning and execution - yours emphasizes recognizing and seizing opportunities. Neither is right or wrong, but they aren't generalizable in the sense you've argued here. \n\nContrasting on that a bit more - there's absolutely nothing wrong with saying \"sure, there's plenty of plumbers in my area - there's no unique opportunity for plumbers - but dammit, I want to run my own plumbing business.\" Success for that guy has zero to do with recognizing an opportunity and 100% to do with his ability to execute. His success requires a different skillset than yours does.",

Once you do the research and you have followup questions to what you learned, then great, please ask them. It may sound mean, and maybe it  is meant to be mean, but if you have to ask reddit answer basic question that you can spend 60 seconds to lookup, how are you going to survive the road of entrepreneurship when you have to depend on someone else all the time for every little thing. /rant",

            "I really appreciate this! It\u2019s helped me clear my head a bit about the \u201cis my idea really worth it\u201d question \u2026\n\nTo add my two cents, I grew up with a dad who had his own accounting practice for 40+ years - not a serial entrepreneur by any means, but started and stayed with one business. I picked up a couple of things from that: \n\n- Entrepreneurship is more a mindset than a job profile. While I work for an accounting firm myself, I am still entrepreneurial about what clients we approach or how I do my work. While on mat leave, I still found a way to volunteer time that can add value to my company, help others and build my profile. It usually doesn\u2019t make sense to do this for someone else, but if the pieces fall correctly it can be worthwhile. In my case, my entrepreneurial approach to my job means faster promotion prospects, regular salary raises and insurance / PTO covered for me that I would not have if I started my own business. And that\u2019s ok. \n\n- Starting a business does not mean freedom. In fact, my father drilled into me that by working for himself, he was actually working for each and every one of his clients - while other people have 1 employer, he had to juggle and balance and keep happy 20-30 employers at a time. \n\nThat being said, OP, what was your answer to teaching kids to be successful / your classes and camp business? I need to know more for my 5 YO!",
            "Yeah, quite an interesting story. I agree with many points.\n\nI've never found myself being the smartest amoung my surroundings, and that was painfu... very benificial. Ilearned from people around me. My \"good luck\" was that six of my 8 very close friends became enterpreneurs, so did I!\n\nBut I never copied them. I found my own way relying on my education and experience that I gained as empoyed electrical engineer.\n\nI was also lucky because during 10 years as an employee I changed 5 employers and 5 engineering roles. \n\nMy bad luck is that during my way I was only an engineer. I did not learn practical sales or management and my additinal studying courses were not very helpful. So every time I get a new customer I think as an engineer first, I think about how to produce a good product, not how to sell it. I even do not care about signing a contract and start working on a project without an advanced payment.\n\nI make many mistakes just because while I was a student my teachers told us that a person must produce for the goverment and goverment must sell an distribute the product.. It was a kinda shame to think about yourself as a potential good salesperson because seles people \"do not produce anything, they do not know anything about the product, they just annoy everyone around\". \n\nWhat a communist bustards..",

I purchased Lemlist on AppSumo a while ago, and one of the recent innovations they came up with was the GIF-to-video embeds in the auto-emails. In their case, it\u2019s light personalization, meant to be a single short video sent to multiple recipients (the personalized bit is the salutation in the email and the text overlay on the GIF Saying, \u201cHi, John/Debbie/whoever, this is Max\u201d\n\nI love the breakdown, too: the more expensive jobs are responding better, and that\u2019s where you have bigger profit margins. That\u2019s classic 80/20 analysis: 20% of your clients deliver 80% of your profits (approximately!), so focus on that 20%. You may want to read Richard Koch\u2019s classic The 80/20 Principle if you haven\u2019t already done so. Applied systematically, it will help you grow faster than you ever imagined, with minimal risk. If you aren\u2019t into books, just look up 80/20 or the Pareto Principle on Google ... there are plenty of online resources explaining it in detail.\n\nGood luck!

And it's interesting how you figured out how to do it via email. \n\nVideo is a powerful medium. Like the phone. Making connections with customer to that last is interesting. \n\nYou can also put the video on a sub extension off the domain, like help.com/ videolink and send that to email and it would probably not scare away customers. \n\nBut it would require embedding a video player within your website. Which can't be that hard to do.\n\nSince you have email only and not phone, but if you asked for phone you could call customers for return visits. Most sites send too much email. So I'd personally prefer to call previous customers and maybe send one email to the website video. \n\nOr calendar tools exist, so you can send them a calendar link to schedule a call. Which would be more diplomatic. \n\nI don't know but customers typically trust emails from a valid website an don't think it's spam. As long as the message is friendly.",

Yes, 6% of 500 is 30, but if you gained 30 additional sales on top of whatever your \"normal\" sales rate was, you're probably closer to 100%.  For example, you send out 500 quotes and get 30 sales.

Anything that takes you months to build is not going to be successful. Success comes from a deep passion for your product and your willing to build it for nobody but yourself. Your story seems like you really cared about the launch and thought it would change your life instantly. You can\u2019t chase the users, you have to chase the product. Great products are the ones that succeed. Building a product in a couple of months and expecting it to be successfully is naive. Focus on building a great product and less on the attention. The attention will only\nCome from a great product. You also\nMentioned that people only cared about a free product, why did you think otherwise? People aren\u2019t just going to give you money.

            "Great post, thanks for sharing. \n\nFirst of all, it's still really early in the journey, if i'm not mistaken you launched an MVP of this a month ago. That you have $0 MRR now despite a lot of interest is exactly the point of launching early to test if there's real willingness to pay.\n\nMy advice would be to timebound it; if by x month you still don't have any validation, it might just mean that this isn't a good idea to pursue - and that's completely okay! There are many, many others out there that can work and it can be extremely exciting to launch them fast and iterate, now you have done one.\n\nMy two cents hypothesis on your product: \n- jobseekers are very cash sensitive (sometimes even irrationally so, trying to cut burn in any possible way), which might make this hard to ever monetize. \n- if there's something to monetize, it might be more on the employer side (which is how it works today with recruiters - jobseekers don't pay them, employers do). Eg: premium listing, premium matching\n- and if you still want to monetize the jobseeker, maybe there's something to offer on the workflow of applying to those jobs instead of discovery; if you automate applying to 150 jobs in seconds (including eg: writing customized emails of why it would be a great fit) and offer some services like interview advice along the way, it could be a neat way to monetize those as premium features. I.e use the discovery / matching as a free hook, upsell these features. Why? Because intuitively the jobseeker now thinks about conversion to a job instead of discovery of potential jobs - it's more tangible and risk averse to pay for those features\n\nHappy to chat more in DM, and good luck!",

            "I completely disagree with this.\n\nThe reason office 'perks' are so popular is very simple - because:\n\n1. The company can get them for a cheaper price than an individual employee. E.g. 100 coffees = $400; 1 barista for 3 hours, beans and milk = $100\n2. Carrying and storing items is extremely bothersome. Even something as simple as eating a fresh, crispy apple at lunch time requires a lot of planning for an employee (going to the supermarket, transporting it, making sure you eat it when it's ripe...) - whereas getting 100 fresh apples delivered to the office kitchen each day is easy as pie.\n\nOnce you lose the economies of scale that an office provide, perks are no longer perks - and they start to compete with your base salary. There is no cost or time advantage when you need to deliver something to an employee's house.",

It's all about execution. \n* You're right that logistics is a huge part of this. Screw that up and you're toast. \n* It's not HR managers but Office managers that you want to approach. They're the ones that make the awesome happen for their teams. HR is just the boring admin stuff that BambooHR deals with. \n* Cocktail kit, lunch kit, makeovers and group lunches with delivered lunch boxes are great ideas. \n* The trick is to make it easy for the office manager with a turnkey solution that they trust will work. You absolutely can not fuck this up because you'll make them look bad in the worst way - you'll disappoint their team. \n\nAs a practical matter, I know our office manager won't use your service unless you clearly have your act together and are trustworthy - and she can trust that you won't mess this up. Price is not an issue - corporations have tons of cash. It's more about quality, reliability and making sure it's fun.

Female partners got a perfume gift and male partners a wine gift. Employees got a choice between wine, spirits or perfume. \n\n\\- For my birthday I also got a wine box. \n\n(Thing to note: boss also owns a liquor store, so none of the booze was below \"top 10% in the world\" categories, so b-day box of 8 wines was probably around E150 and x-mas box around E50 per gift)\n\n\\- A 13th month (as it's called here). Which, at this company, was done based on performance both individually as well as team (meaning half of the month's salary bonus was based on your own performance and the other half based on team capability of meeting goals (set the previous year to make it fair)). (Thing to note: companies have started offering a 13th month straight up as an end-of-year bonus and adding a 14th month based on performance - also to note: bonuses are taxed at 40% vs the normal 37%)\n\n\\- Monthly internet compensation of E50\n\n\\- Monthly phone compensation of E50\n\n\\- Fitness center subscription of E25 p/m\n\n\\- 100% pension coverage\n\n(In before anyone asks: left because this company also had in incredibly high work-pressure.

(Which is also late for me as I just spend 700 building a sit/stand desk)\n\n\\- 50/50 pension coverage (without requirement you match their input - some archaic companies still require that -> 401k for the US-based readers)\n\nCan say though: people do get hired to help / make sure that there is a high staff-satisfaction.

            "Hi I'm new here. I read this entire thread. I think this is a good idea. While there may be some companies that are going to not give perks (a way to save money) there will still be a lot of companies who would love to do that.\n\nBut as I was reading, I was also thinking about gift basket types as discussed above. I think these are great for new employees, holidays, etc. I have so many ideas spinning around about how this could work. The first that comes to mind is when hired, someone would have a list of the types of perks they would like. There would be an approximate company limit. The new employee (or old ones when the program is initiated) would be able to review a list of perks they'd want to receive, and could choose. For example, a lot of folks don't drink or wouldn't want a basket filled with salts, cheeses and sugary foods. So if they filled out a checkbox with the things they wanted only, that would work. Like that one company that offers all the healthy nuts and snacks - I'd love to get that box but not the cheese/chocolates/salty crackers one. People need to have healthy options. Also vegan options. I also think people would want to get the same box all the time, or even the same themed box. Healthy nuts and dried fruits snacks? Yay! Second time? Yay! Third time...oh okay. There are also great fresh flowers of the month club, potted plants of the month (different ones) those could be really fun. Fruit boxes are nice. Also instead of alcoholic drinks, ciders and sparkling drinks would be a good choice. Also there could be technology gift bags ...pay your internet for a month (up to $70), or fun tech gadgets. Most would probably prefer useful things in this arena or the items would get wasted and the employee disgusted that they got sent \"this junk\". How about a coffee of the month bag. I know I'd like that.\n\nI think there will be a mix of people returning to work at some point, but certainly some can stay home for good. The ones who stay home should definitely be included in perks and office benefits.",
            "Frankly, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a one size fits all solution to perks at one company, let alone at many companies. Snacks and alcohol aren\u2019t something that every employee would like or use, and while I\u2019m not an accountant, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the tax implications of those type of perks are different than what providing those \u201con campus\u201d (pre-covid) were. Plus the additional cost of shipping/overhead. \n\nWhat\u2019s becoming commonplace now is a stipend (whether monthly/weekly/quarterly) that employees can use for wellness (fitness classes, gym equipment, lunch, etc) instead and then expense it for reimbursement. It\u2019s flexible, has almost no overhead, and meets the needs of pretty much every employee. \n\nI really don\u2019t see a subscription box model becoming a leader in this space, but I could be wrong.",
            "How do you write ideas that are not too specific? My business ideas usually derive too much from my experience, and I doubt can be applicable. Here's what I mean.   \n\n\n A service that plans fun things to do inside. Now with the lockdown, all the services that looked for things in the area are pretty much useless. Whenever I google something fun to do, only outside ideas come up. How about creating a service that comes up with fun things to do at home? Or it can be a community.\n\n1. A service that allows choosing coffee shops and restaurants with no people. A good chance to let less popular establishments get clients - and to stay safe now.\n2. A [peer-to-peer marketplace](https://syndicode.com/blog/marketplace-application-checklist/) that connects marketers and small businesses. So many of my friends have skills and products but don't know how to promote them. On the other hand, I also know quite a lot of marketers who want to have a business but don't have any product or hard skills to offer.\n3. An interviewing platform where you can instantly find a person for an interview. I don't mean a serious tool like Help A Reporter Out, but rather, a community where people can quickly interview each other. Would be very helpful for niche businesses and small communities.\n4. Systems for learning skills. Whatever skill you have and can share with others, there's a chance that there's no solid automated system for getting there. Lecturio is a good example of a platform that cleated a system for medstudents, helping them prepare for examns. There are so many fields that lack such systems.\n5. An extension that turns text into Anki cards. Be it language subtitles or a PowerPoint presentation (but this is very specific to my medschool and language learning needs, and I'm not sure if it's not too narrow).\n\nThese examples are obviously specific to my experiences, but you can apply the same logic while thinking of your routine and field, and expertise.

            "Hi, I\u2019ve been an agency CEO/founder for about a decade (specializing on startups). Here\u2019s my perspective:\n\n1. An MVP agency is one of the worst business models out there. Just think about it for a second. Your target market is first time founders with no capital. That is the most challenging ICP out there. They want to pay as little as possible and they are incredibly demanding. That\u2019s totally reasonable, the stakes are high for them. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it makes for a terrible business model.\n2. Heavily related to the point above, even if you can land a few clients (likely by offering rock bottom prices), it\u2019s incredibly hard to \u201cdelight customers.\u201d Most MVPs, like new startups, fail. You will be at least partially blamed when 95% of the MVPs fail. That means it\u2019s much harder to generate word of mouth which is historically how most agencies get off the ground. \n3. You\u2019re going against the macro trends. This is another incredibly hard place to be. Between no code, AI, etc it\u2019s never been easier for non technical founders to build an MVP themselves. Convincing someone, without much capital, to pay for someone to do something they can figure out on their own is only going to get harder over time.\n4. Starting an agency of any kind without a track record is nearly impossible, especially nowadays. At the early stage, the founder\u2019s track record is everything. And the successful agencies are typically started by people who\u2019ve spent 10+ years working at famous companies. They have pedigree and access to deal flow built in from the start. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to play in the MVP space, there are only a couple viable approaches imo. Either build a SaaS product that helps entrepreneurs build their own MVPs for cheap. Or if you\u2019re committed to the agency/done for you model, then you have to go upmarket. But then you\u2019re ultimately becoming a dev shop. And the competition for the upmarket clients is insane. And again, without a track record, high pedigree background, it\u2019s going to be hard to say the least. \n\nI\u2019d be happy to be proven wrong. But I would encourage you to pause for a moment and really think this through from a fundamental perspective.",
            "Why would someone use you rather then the trillion other \"agencies\" that do this.  Also you are a freelancer, not an agency.  Maybe come up with a marketing strategy first.",
            "Okay, so i read all the replies and i've just gotta ask... what's an MVP? I literally have no idea what is being sold here.",
            "You need to learn how to derisk things for customers. Too much money? Free demo mockup. No scope? Free discovery.\n\nHave you never built an app before? There's no way to get past no experience.",
            "Are $3,400 and $5,900 one time for lifetime? No testimonials on your website.",
            "You assume they don't trust you, but maybe they simply don't need you.",
            "heyy, I just helped a few other agencies with lead gen and getting client, understand that you are facing a credibility issue\n\nHere are the 3 steps to get over this (this is the exact process how I got my first few clients without social proof and no testimonials):\n\nthe steps are much simpler than you'd think but the difficulty is not getting distracted by all the fancy shiny tools that other people market\n\nStep 1 gain clarity on your value\n\nPlease note that this is not an invitation to buy or try your services direct, but a chance to showcase your experience and expertise\n\nStep 2 engage with target customers online to build relationship first \n\nEg Facebook group, fiverr etc \n\nStep 3 Sell (or what i call present offer)\n\nBecuase they got so much value, they see you as someone who know what you're talking about, and then, and only then you talk further where you show them how to work with you.\n\nI don't like and never have put pressure in sales, when you learn to put out value in a strategic way, it is easy to sign clients - they just want more from you lol\n\nOne tip i would say is always focus on the specific result you can help your client get --\n\nYour client doesn't need another course or more work, they want the result. So focus on that can help you sell and sign clients much more easily.\n\nOf course that s just prelim relay based on limited context and understanding of what you do, lmk if i can be of more help",
            "Getting started from zero is hard.\n\nHave you interviewed people in your network/market to assess demand?\n\nIf there is strong demand, clients may see the price but may not understand the value of what they're buying--especially if they're non-technical.\n\nWould you pay $50K for a neurosurgeon who has already done 200 successful surgeries?  What about a neurosurgeon where you're his first patient? Like you said, clients need evidence of previous success and to a fledging non-technical founder, $3,400 may feel like $50K for something unproven.\n\nTry niching down to a particular market segment and do three different projects in return for testinominals, success stories with metrics (e.g. client A spent 6 months struggling to build a website and with our solution, went live in 3 weeks and already made $1000), and minimum 2-3 referrals from each after successful delivery.  Bend over backwards and really over deliver.\n\nIf you really believe in your product and your ability to help clients reach success, $10,200 (though, I'm guessing your cost of service is much less) might be a good investment in yourself to add momentum to your flywheel.\n\nGood luck; we're all rooting for you because most of us are also trying to figure it out.",
            "Trust without track record? Do things for free, at first. Like literally for people to actually review you. Then eventually offer services on Fiverr to build more credibility and and reviews, or do discounted services for early-stage startups to gain, again, more testimonials.",
            "Unfortunately, I have this t-shirt.  You build out the infrastructure without the customers.  It's costly and sucks.  That said, you can pivot now.  You need proof of concept.  You  need to work with 1-2 clients at  a low cost and have them do testimonials.  You can use the examples as case studies.  Or, partner with a friend who has an idea and help them out.",

Try to get as much of the cognitive work of figuring out what you have to do out of the way so that you can avoid the negative effects of repeatedly having to switch your brain from \u201cwhat do I have to do next\u201d to \u201chow do I do that,\u201d and instead you can spend some time figuring out the next several things and go knock them all out in a more organized way that\u2019s easier for your brain to digest.

            "Sure, some people are [talented](https://images.app.goo.gl/QQiQKUPDbPAqU1TLA). But for most, what others view as talent is really the result of persistent work and incremental improvements. You've probably built a ton of skills that are beyond the average person's abilities, and your experience has likely been invaluable. You're just not in a good mental place to see that right now. \n\nAlso, \"I have always wanted to be successful\" and \"I don't want to to be average\" are fine attitudes for an entrepreneur, but that cannot be your sole driver. If you're not passionate about a certain field or problem, then that kind of attitude is going to lead to 'shiny object syndrome' where you bounce from one idea to the next, constantly pursuing the next \"big thing\" or meme gimmick like crypto, NFTs, or anything talked about on WallStreetBets. I suspect you've fallen into this mentality, especially when you say you've lost 90% of your net worth through \"investing.\" WTF are you doing gambling the majority of your net worth on risky investments?\n\nAsk yourself this: have you actually identified a problem and have determined that an SaaS play is the best way to solve that problem? Or did you look at the revenue models and hype around SaaS and decide you wanted a piece of that action? To be fair, I'm pessimistic about SaaS startups. There are applications where SaaS makes sense, but I see it constantly being shoehorned in where it doesn't really make sense. I feel that SaaS has become the next overhyped \"pop startup\" like drop shipping before it.\n\nI'm just some stranger on the internet, but I think it's super important to take a step back and realize there's a lot more to life then money, and that success can be defined as way more than just making as much money as possible. Take a couple days and just breathe. Consider seeing a therapist to help with your stress and to help you recognize your own self-worth. Start hanging out with other entrepreneurs in your area - a monthly get together with like minded people where you all get a chance to complain can be extremely cathartic. Hell, do something small like rearranging your room and your office. Then when you come back to your startup, make sure you're actually solving a problem that real potential paying customers have.\n\nGood luck.",

            "The fact that you have your parent's basement to fall back on is great, some people don't have that option. I would first take some time to ask yourself what does success look like and mean to you, because if we're talking about material possession, understand that at some point, everything is just an upgraded version of what you already have; fancier car, bigger house, you really can't eat any more than 3 meals a day, you have no reason to wear more than one outfit at a time, etc. And you don't need to be multi-billionaire like Bill Gates to afford luxury, an employee at Microsoft can easily afford it. If it's admiration, understand the price you are paying and if it's worth the effort because realistically you'll be working all the time as an entrepreneur to go out and socialize often, is it really worth grinding every day to have that one moment of significant at an annual family Christmas gathering where you're getting praised and patted on the back. Ask yourself why success is important to you, what is it going to provide for you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverybody in the top 10% was once in the bottom 10%, if you truly have drive and ambition like you think you do, you would use that to figure out how to better your craft. Maybe what you are doing right now isn't aligned with your value so you're not motivated to learn to get better at it, you just need to be in a different industry if that's the case. The top 1% household earners are about 400K, HOUSEHOLD, meaning that between a partner and yourself, if you both earn 400K together, you're in the top 1%, if being average is your fear, know that this is top 1% and it's more attainable than you think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe not what you want to hear, but you also said that you must face reality and this is reality: there's many people that immigrate here not knowing English, they have to just figure it out to first translate it to a language that they understand and then do the actual work. I know people that cannot quit their soul sucking tech jobs to pursue entrepreneurship or even get another job because only certain companies can legally sponsor their green card to stay in this country, there's a max quota of green card that can be given each year for each country, if you're from India, it's like a 10 year waiting list IF you're lucky to get onto the waiting queue. Imagine being in those position, what you have is the privilege to keep failing and staying in your parent's basement as a safety net, accept that privilege because as long as you're still breathing, you still have time on your side. Really, take time to learn why it didn't work out and either fix it or move onto something new. For every successful venture, there's many more failed ones prior but we don't hear about it. We don't hear about the battles that people go through, we don't know anything beyond the surface level, maybe people aren't even happy reaching success, who knows. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am also questioning why you lost 90% of your net worth investing.

And shame can kill people. \n\nIt's easy for strangers on Reddit to tell you what to do but every situation is unique and very personal.\n\nSo think about finding a close friend or a family member that can help you bring everything out into the open, admit that you lost your job, admit that you lost money by investing, admit that what you strongly believed in is no longer something that is going to happen any time soon. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe step #1 is to figure out the best way for you to work around your shame, share your situation with your family, it didn't work out, so what? Every war has many battles, you lose some and you win some.\n\nAnd the fact that you were able to admit to yourself what is going on by writing this post means that you may be ready to make some changes. it won't be easy but you have another 40 years to work on it.\n\nAnd maybe think about what entrepreneurship is all about. It is not about personal success. it's not about having \"talent\" but rather about seeing opportunities that others don't see and making them happen. It's a risky business and with risk comes the possibility of temporary failure and the possibility of great success.\n\nCan you write down on a piece of paper what are the three biggest fears that you have right now? Don't show anybody, it just for your eyes. \n\nAnd then try to explain in writing what is it about each fear that is triggering so much anxiety and your \"fight or flight\" emotion.\n\nTry to find one or more solutions for getting around the situation that you are in. \n\nDo NOT take any action yet. Sleep on it. \n\nGive your mind some time to reflect on it. Hopefully you have that trusted person who listens but doesn't judge - and - maybe give you some fresh ideas...",

While your analogies may be true if you believe them it gives you something to blame. Take the blame. You are sitting in the basement. You lost 90% of your investment. Well that\u2019s not investment that\u2019s gambling. Sorry but investing is usually not that risky in a diversified portfolio. What you are doing is trying to make a quick Buck. Get a job. Get your own place and find out what it\u2019s like to survive. That\u2019s the part you are missing. Drive and ambition don\u2019t get you out of there. Circumstances that are immediate and consequential will. I suggest you reevaluate and actually listen to your friends.",
            "You become what you believe you are.\n\nYou believe you are a failure living in a basement with no talent and that you suck.\n\nYou need to reframe. There are a ton of no-talent people out there making it big.\n\nI will say this; unless you're making a lot of money, you're not an entrepreneur. The term has been taken hostage as a trendy term for anybody trying to start a business or with an idea. We need to go back to the original definition. When I started my first company 25 years ago, very few people we entrepreneurs. \n\nI'm not on the spectrum, I have tech abilities + business skills + people skills. And by people skills, I mean I get along great with executives. It's challenging for me to work with employees that have a closed or fixed mindset, especially when they are on a high horse.\n\nYou need to take a job, not because you failed, but so you can learn other aspects of business from that job. I don't care what the job is, you aren't taking the job to settle. You take it to get your foot in the door somewhere, where you can do the work you are hired for but then you go in there and you start learning about everything the company does and how they do it. You're basically there to treat the job as an education. While everybody else wants more money to do more work, you just do the work because you realize the more you learn and know the more you will become worth. \n\nThe current employee mindset is awesome. Almost everybody wants money before they have the ability to have earned it. They're called earnings for a reason, but this has been lost because so many companies are hurting for employees they're caving in. And most people are not good at management/leadership, they can't even manage themselves so they end up on this high horse.\n\nAnother reason you need to take a job is that it's going to get REALLY hard to start a business right now unless you are solving a problem that is going to appear here shortly. The Atlanta Fed just revised GDP to -1%.\n\nThe wave of layoffs has already started and it will take a couple of months for this to ripple through the economy. But, the wave has formed, it is in motion, and it is heading this way.\n\nIt will be best to get a job and become of value before more hiring freezes happen. You get in, you add value, make sure that if you're getting $N salary that you're generating 3X that for the company. \n\nOnly now will I ask. What was the SaaS product? Why does it have bugs? Poor testing? How do you QA? What language? What environment? What problem does it solve? What is the potential market for the software? No pie in the sky stuff, if there are 100,000 potential clients, don't tell me you think you can get 10% of the market if you can't even get 10 customers.",

What about aspects that are less tangible, like art?\n\nI sell clothing with custom designs. The things that differentiate my brand are:\n\n1) niche rave/party/drug cultural symbols in the designs\n\n2) entire collection is made from a synthetic blend of altheticwear fabric. \n\nHow can I promote the designs with words? My only idea is to show a picture of the clothing with the design and hope that people like it. Is there anything that I can say in a call to action other than promoting a sale? Having a sale button seems like the default call to action for any clothing retailer. Is that the best practice? Have you seen anything else be successful in a similar situation?\n\nAt a rave it can get sweaty, so this is moisture wicking and breathable clothing. Cotton fabric can get damp, heavy and have visible stains, My clothes are made out of a synthetic quick drying blend, it's very similar to the fabric used by other athletic wear companies like Nike. \n\nThe fabric is is breathable and hydrophobic so there's no visible sweat stains. I think all these features are very valuable but I'm not sure how to talk about them. In an attractive or exciting way. \n\nI thought about the value it brings to the customer instead of the features. I can remember my own experience feeling uncomfortable and embarrassed rolling on Molly at a festival. I was having a great time but I was dripping sweat. I felt awkward talking to people because I felt so self-conscious about the sweat stains.\n\nHow can I promote the second differentiator? I don't want to market my brand as \"the sweaty\" person brand. I think anyone can enjoy breathable, lightweight clothing to party in. But the anti-sweat stain features are valuable. \n\nI don't want it to seem this clothing is somehow medical related or only for sweaty people. The word \"moisture-wicking\" is not very sexy so I don't feel great leading with that. \n\nI'm feeling a little bit stuck. Do you have any advice or suggestions? Thanks!",

            "This is an excellent breakdown of building an AI business with several key insights worth highlighting:\n\nThe most impressive part isn't just getting to paying customers in 2 months - it's the methodical, no-nonsense approach to execution. A few standout points:\n\n1. The focused niche strategy - starting with service businesses they already understand rather than trying to build a generic chatbot for everyone\n2. Practical use of AI tools (like Bolt) for design work instead of getting stuck trying to perfect everything internally\n3. The partnership approach - finding a technical co-founder on Reddit and doing a clean 50/50 split, with each person focusing on their strengths\n\nTheir mindset section is particularly valuable, especially: \"This ain't a dunk contest, there are no points for originality. This is more like gymnastics.\" That's such a clear way of explaining why \"but the market is saturated\" is often a poor excuse.\n\nThe transparency about using existing tools and platforms (Themeforest, Stripe, WPEngine) rather than building everything from scratch shows real business sense - focusing on solving customer problems rather than reinventing wheels.\n\nWould be interested to hear how the customer acquisition strategy evolves beyond the initial one-per-day from personal networks. That's often the make-or-break transition for these kinds of businesses.\n\nHow are you thinking about scaling your customer outreach beyond your personal network?",

I searched my local market and there were no competitors, and the business model is so new that there is little to none global solution, and after all it doesn't matter if someone does it better if your potential customers haven't ever heard about it\n\nIt looks like in your case you were more specialized to a specific problem with your chatbot, and not just making a default customer support  ai chatbot solution.",

And you could've coasted at that job while you built something on the side.\n* **Injustice in Recruitment:** It's nice to have ideals about how you're going to change the world. But you need paying customers first. Focus on marketing & product. Then ideals.\n* **Ideas Overload:** A lot of ideas = no clear idea. Pick an idea. VALIDATE before you build.

Don't build first.)\n\n**More tips to avoid falling off a cliff:**\n\n* **Statistics:** Most startups fail. Indie hacker projects that focus on B2B, tech, and fiance do better.\n* **Lily Pad:** The best approach is to build something while you're at your current job.

(Jump to your next lily pad.)\n* **Stress Brain:** Living off saving is scary but feels like freedom ... at first. As the months go on it plays tricks on your brain. Your world starts collapsing. The stress increases. Your brain won't operate efficiently. This will make reaching customers and building features harder and harder. You've been warned.\n* **Live with Family:** Do everything that's possible to cut your burn rate. Living with family will reduce your rent. The less money going out, the longer a runway you'll have.\n* **Be Interviewing:** With the stress brain and dwindling savings, looking for a job at month 12 will be a bad situation. Be open to continually interviewing. Or take on some part-time work. This will cut your burn rate and be a stress reliever. If you're always interviewing, then if you decide to take on a job, you'll have an offer to consider (or a network to reach out to).\n* **More tips:** [https://twitter.com/adamdenverco/highlights](https://twitter.com/adamdenverco/highlights)",

            "First, let me start off with this: That really sucks, I'm sorry it happened to you.  But... as a programmer and startup guy, let me point out some things that may or may not be obvious to you, but stand out to me.  Second, let me say I'm not defending the sleazy programmer who ripped you off in more ways than one in any way whatsoever.  That said...\n\nFirst, honestly, man, as much as you're going to hate to hear this, mistake #1 was not really knowing what you wanted, or not having it defined properly.  Hiring the wrong coder and not knowing how to manage him made that exponentially worse.  What you call \"developer whiplash\", programmers call \"Feature Creep\" and if they're not scrupulous and they're more invested in a paycheck than an outcome, they're going to be more than happy to keep working their way down the ever growing list as long as they money keeps coming in.\n\nLearning to code is not a bad thing.  But as /u/notsofst pointed out, that's not necessarily going to help you in the long term, either.  \n\n> Every time we needed a change, it took way longer than I thought it should to put in place.\n\nWelcome to software development.  Particularly from the viewpoint of a non-programmer.  It's always going to take way longer than you think it should.  Because programming can be very difficult, even if you're very good at it, depending on what's asked of you.  Tacking things on the end (see Mistake #0) can also make the problem exponentially more difficult than if you'd mentioned \"Feature X\" before you started.  But again, the programmer of low values is happy to tack that on and work on that, too.  And in the end, he's fired, you're out of money and frustrated, he's relieved he doesn't have to finished and someone who actually knows what they're doing gets called in to fix it (if possible) or start over from scratch (was Rails even the right technology you needed?  Hard to say... why did you go with a Rails guy in the first place?).\n\nSource: I've been a professional programmer for 20 years, most of that time freelance, done the startup thing a handful of times, both on the outside and inside of a project, and been the guy that got called at various points to clean up someone's mess when someone saw $$$ and got in over their head by telling someone they could deliver something they couldn't.\n\nHaving said all that... let me give a couple of suggestions to help you and anyone else reading this.  2 key things: 1) Get your idea/app as defined as humanly possible and 2) set milestones and pay according to those.\n\n1) Definition.  Here's what I tell everybody who tells me \"hey, I have a great idea for an app/website/game/whatever\" -- \"hey, neat idea!  Here's what you should do... take a yellow legal pad, turn it 90 degrees (if your app will be landscape or you're developing a website) and draw out every single page of your app/website.  Every one.  What does it look like?  How many buttons are they and what do they do?  See this button that says, \"Sign me up\"?  Move to a new page and draw out what information you want to capture.  The button the says, \"demo\"?  Move to a new page and draw out what that's going to show and how it's going to do it.  (You get the idea).  Doing this will force you to think through the process, instead of someone else doing that for you -- and since it's your idea, they're always going to be less qualified.  And you don't want someone you're paying by the hour doing it, that's for sure.  As you think through this process, you'll come up with more questions that need to be asked, but also some answers and probably some new ideas, as well.  And if you can come away from this process with a better definition, no matter how long it takes -- whether it's a couple hours at the coffee shop, or a couple hours several days a week for a month at the coffee shop -- it's going to be time VERY well spent.  When you're done, you'll have a very good idea of what you want, a rough idea of what it should look like and how it should work.  And so will the graphic designer and programmer that you hire.  Then it's not \"hey, I've got this idea, can you build this?\" -- it's \"this is what I want, this is how it works, these are the buttons that should be there, this is what that do.  Button 23 goes to page 23, etc.\" -- THEN, you can get an *accurate* quote (more accurate, anyway) from a programmer and a graphic designer.  Because you know what you want, they'll have an easier time building what you want.\n\nBTW - do you know how many people have done this?  Absolutely zero.  Which is a shame, because I've heard some good ideas along the way.  But if they're not willing to put in a few hours to flesh it out, I'm not willing to pursue any part of it whatsoever.  I've got plenty of my own good ideas if I get bored and need something to code.  :)\n\nB) After you have bought some definition to what you want, set milestones with the programmer of things you want to see happen and when they should happen.  Take the advice of the programmer here, because it might make more sense to do things in an order that doesn't necessarily make sense to you.  Also, it takes a little while to have any visible result when you're starting a new program from scratch.  When the milestone is met, payment is made.  Now, if you keep adding on new ideas, then yeah, timelines are going to go out the window, but hopefully, you've established your ideas and your minimum viable product in step A on the legal pad.\n\nAnyway... I could probably go on for a while and have thought about offering a webinar about making your idea into an app or program and may elaborate more on this stuff later on...  but that should help.\n\nTL;DR: the more definition of your idea you start with, the more likely things are to turn out well.  Also, set milestones and pay for results.\n\nedit: **Thank you, kind stranger, for the reddit Gold.**  My first time in 8 years on reddit!",

            "I always admire those that learn to do it themselves, there is a lot more to learn. The dangers of amateur code can leave a lot of startups dead in the water.\n\nReally, you need to learn Project Management inside out, processes like Scrum and Agile can lead to very high transparency and rapid, iterative turnaround without significant up front planning. However to benefit from a iterative process means understanding the process and it's benefits from both a development side and a business side. Many organizations miss the point from both sides. Many businesses view Agile as a way to just get estimates, while many developers just see it as lip service to business people, accounting/tracking the like. It's true purpose is to keep people focussed and unimpeded, and to provide short term organizational flexibility as well as full transparency for the entire team.\n\nAs for programming, there is many things that will come back and bite you down the road, are you following best practices or do you just know how to code? Are you coding conventions disciplined and consistent, are you writing in ways that won't surprise outside developers. How does your project scale as your business scales? will your architecture allow it? Do you have tests or automation verifying the process? \n\nThe list really goes on, and it's not simple. Naivety will make things look simpler then they are, but trust me I've seen enough hacked together solutions that are beyond fixing, the organization technical debt themselves into a situation that can't be fixed.\n\nSo, while I think it's great to have knowledge and understanding, and knowing programming will definitely help you communicate better with programmers, finding a expert is still a invaluable addition to your technical presence. In the least, find trusted technical consultation to guide you early on, and try your best to understand the why of what they suggest.\n\nI'm sorry the developer you found was ethically sleezy, outsourcing work behind your back and not delivering, that doesn't mean all developers are like that. It can be very hard to however understand a developers skill level if you don't have the skills yourself. Even hiring as a expert can be difficult to truly appraise people, I tend to think I'm good at rating new potential developers but even I've been let down by people who I thought were better then they were.",
            "So, kudos for writing all of this out, couldn't have been easy. We learn from stuff like this and it benefits so many people, it's no small feat.\n\nEveryone who has ever coded professionally has their head explode in rage when they hear things like \"*No one on my team knew how to code.*\" \n\nIt reads like \"**Let's enter an incredibly challenging space that requires large amounts of highly specialized knowledge, ignore that entirely and bet the farm on something we aren't even sure on how to implement!**\"\n\nImagine deciding to get into construction management and not knowing the first thing about how a building is made, who does what job, what crap work looks like, what good work looks like, or even what meets code and what doesn't. If you saw someone do that, you'd probably think they were incredibly foolish. A great way to throw money away with little to show for it.\n\nYour entire business depends on your product working. Your product working depends entirely on competent programmers and a project lead that's been there before and knows what they're doing. Absent both, everyone tends to fail pretty miserably. \n\nPeople that don't come from a technical background seem to view these things as being as easy as hiring a clerk to file some papers, and of no more importance than that. \"**I'm doing 90% of the work, I have an idea, sales people, surely this little technical 10% will work itself out, what evs.**\"\n\nOnly it's not 10% if your entire business depends on it working, and working well before anything else can succeed. Even the best sales people in the world can't sell a product that doesn't work (unless the plan is fraud from the get-go!). \n\nEveryone starts somewhere though, and you seem more self-aware than most business-oriented types in this space that think programming is about as important as filing papers in a cabinet. \n\nIt sounds out like you were able to get out with a lot less damage than most business owners take when a business fails. You didn't declare bankruptcy, go broke, or loose the ability to try again.\n\nAnyway, the only thing more dangerous than someone that knows they know absolutely nothing about programming is someone that knows juuuuuust enough about programming to get everything as wrong as it possibly can be. \n\nIf you can make it work being your own programmer and getting a stable, viable, working product out the door... You'll probably go far in this business.\n",
            "I can code a little, and I made a functional prototype for my idea. But it took me 8 times longer than a pro. I became obsessed trying to perfect my prototype. An old friend who is now a consultant in this area told me to stop wasting time on it and to think how I should market it. He was right, I have sufficient knowledge how it's going to sort of work and how much it will approximately costs but I needed to focus on branding and added features. ",
            "It does sound like the developer was inexperienced, but not because he outsourced it. Outsourcing is totally fine if HE had the ability to properly understand your ideas and take on the job of vetting, managing and holding to account those he outsourced to. The problem here isn't outsourcing. The problem is that a good/experienced developer doesn't just ask what you want and make it. Almost nobody would get what they wanted.\n\nWhen I sit down with somebody and they tell me what they want, 9 times out of 10, they're wrong. And I don't mean that in an \"I'll make something better\" way. I mean that as I'm listening I can hear that they're omitting something, that they're forgetting a detail, when they're inconsistent in their terminology or description of a process. I think of how their many ideas fit together and might be unexpectedly jarring. I think of how, as their product grows their choice may make a later addition harder to make. As a developer, I'm not just a person who writes code, I'm an expert at understanding and designing complex systems and procedures whether or not code is involved. As an experienced developer, I'm good at helping people find out what they want in order to avoid that \"developer whiplash\" you speak of.\n\nAs one anecdote, there was one time I was developing a product for a client. They described the product and I could easily make that product. However, as a good developer, I described to them how I could see where they were going with this and if I gave them what they asked for, I think it'd create some problems down the line for them and described what they were. They agreed and ultimately that led to them asking for something else that I suggested as an alternative. That's at least as valuable, if not more so, than any code I wrote. Good developers don't just write code, they help you understand what code you even want written.\n\nMeanwhile, in that project, I did outsource some things (although I did tell the client in my case). I outsourced the things that at my skillset were basically just busywork so that I could focus more on the bigger parts of the project. I wrote test cases and rejected the work of the person I outsourced to twice because outsourcing doesn't free me of responsibility. As a result, the work I outsourced was of great quality, saved money (I was able to charge less since I delegated these simpler tasks to somebody with a lower rate than myself) and it was able to be better quality than if the original client just outsourced because I used my knowledge to give the outsourcee a very precise specification and had the ability to test and assess their results. Outsourcing is only bad if the developer doesn't take responsibility for it. Ultimately, the client was very happy and everything worked out great.",

            "Same thing happened to me on a smaller scale. I have taken three years of coding including objective C but am not good at coding. Got a freelance developer. Paid them $3k. Their app they created was horrible. Hired another developer. Paid them a few more thousand. App was better but not what we visioned. Started relearning coding instead. ",

            "I remember seeing NextMover when it came out. I was wondering why it shut down so quickly. There are so many of these \"Uber for Moving\" companies now it's insane. I actually included you guys in a post I wrote about Uber for Moving[1].\n\nSo many entrepreneurs and VCs making a go at it.
